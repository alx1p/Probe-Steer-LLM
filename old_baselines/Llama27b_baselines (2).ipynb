              "  'wiki_context': ['The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, often shortened to Hamlet, is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare at an uncertain date between 1599 and 1602. Set in the Kingdom of Denmark, the play dramatises the revenge Prince Hamlet is called to wreak upon his uncle, Claudius, by the ghost of Hamlet\\'s father, King Hamlet. Claudius had murdered his own brother and seized the throne, also marrying his deceased brother\\'s widow. Hamlet is Shakespeare\\'s longest play, and is ranked among the most powerful and influential tragedies in English literature, with a story capable of \"seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others\". The play likely was one of Shakespeare\\'s most popular works during his lifetime, and still ranks among his most performed, topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare Company and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879. It has inspired many other writers – from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles Dickens to James Joyce and Iris Murdoch – and has been described as \"the world\\'s most filmed story after Cinderella\".\\nThe story of Shakespeare\\'s Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth, preserved by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum, as subsequently retold by 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier (hypothetical) Elizabethan play known today as the Ur-Hamlet, though some scholars believe he himself wrote the Ur-Hamlet, later revising it to create the version of Hamlet we now have. He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor, Richard Burbage, the leading tragedian of Shakespeare\\'s time. In the 400 years since its inception, the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century.\\n\\nThree different early versions of the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others. The play\\'s structure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny. One such example is the centuries-old debate about Hamlet\\'s hesitation to kill his uncle, which some see as merely a plot device to prolong the action, but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder, calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, psychoanalytic critics have examined Hamlet\\'s unconscious desires, while feminist critics have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often maligned characters of Ophelia and Gertrude.\\n\\nCharacters\\n\\n*Hamlet – Son of the late King and nephew of the present king\\n*Claudius – King of Denmark and Hamlet\\'s uncle\\n*Gertrude – Queen of Denmark and mother to Hamlet\\n*Polonius – Chief counsellor to the king\\n*Ophelia – Daughter to Polonius\\n*Horatio – True friend to Hamlet\\n*Laertes – Son to Polonius\\n*Voltimand and Cornelius – Courtiers\\n*Rosencrantz and Guildenstern – Courtiers, friends to Hamlet\\n*Osric – a Courtier\\n*Marcellus – an Officer\\n*Bernardo – an Officer\\n*Francisco – a Soldier\\n*Reynaldo – Servant to Polonius\\n*Ghost of Hamlet\\'s Father\\n*Fortinbras – Prince of Norway\\n*Gravediggers – a Sexton\\n*Player King, Player Queen, Lucianus etc. – Players\\n*A Priest\\n*A Captain in Fortinbras\\' army\\n*English Ambassadors\\n*Messengers, Sailors, Lords, Ladies, Guards, Danes (supporters of Laertes)\\n\\nPlot\\n\\nAct I\\n\\nThe protagonist of Hamlet is Prince Hamlet of Denmark, son of the recently deceased King Hamlet, and nephew of King Claudius, his father\\'s brother and successor. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet\\'s widow, Gertrude, Hamlet\\'s mother, and took the throne for himself. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighboring Norway, which culminated when King Hamlet slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway, and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras\\'s infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king\\'s son, Prince Fortinbras, is imminent.\\n\\nOn a cold night on the ramparts of Elsinore, the Danish royal castle, the sentries Bernardo and Marcellus and Hamlet\\'s friend Horatio encounter a ghost that looks like the late King Hamlet.  They vow to tell Prince Hamlet what they have witnessed.\\n\\nAs the Court gathers the next day, while King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly adviser Polonius, Hamlet looks on glumly. After the Court exits, Hamlet despairs of his father\\'s death and his mother\\'s hasty remarriage.  Learning of the Ghost from Horatio, Hamlet resolves to see it himself.\\n\\nAs Polonius\\'s son Laertes prepares to depart for a visit to France, Polonius gives him contradictory advice that culminates in the ironic maxim \"to thine own self be true\". Polonius\\'s daughter, Ophelia, admits her interest in Hamlet, but both Polonius and Laertes warn her against seeking the prince\\'s attention. That night on the rampart, the Ghost appears to Hamlet, telling the prince that he was murdered by Claudius and demanding that Hamlet avenge him. Hamlet agrees and the Ghost vanishes.  The prince confides to Horatio and the sentries that from now on he plans to \"put an antic disposition on\" and forces them to swear to keep his plans for revenge secret. Privately, however, he remains uncertain of the Ghost\\'s reliability.\\n\\nAct II\\n\\nSoon thereafter, Ophelia rushes to her father, telling him that Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and behaving crazily. Polonius blames love for Hamlet\\'s madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude.  As he enters to do so, the king and queen finish welcoming Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two student acquaintances of Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the students investigate the cause of Hamlet\\'s mood and behavior.  Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the King of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father\\'s battles. The forces that Fortinbras conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent against Poland, though they will pass through a portion of Denmark to get there.\\n\\nPolonius tells Claudius and Gertrude his theory regarding Hamlet\\'s behavior, and speaks to Hamlet in a hall of the castle to try to uncover more information. Hamlet feigns madness but subtly insults Polonius all the while. When Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive, Hamlet greets his friends warmly, but quickly discerns that they are spies. Hamlet becomes bitter, admitting that he is upset at his situation but refusing to give the true reason why, instead commenting on \"what a piece of work\" humanity is. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell Hamlet that they have brought along a troupe of actors that they met while traveling to Elsinore. Hamlet, after welcoming the actors and dismissing his friends-turned-spies, plots to stage a play featuring a death in the style of his father\\'s murder, thereby determining the truth of the Ghost\\'s story, as well as Claudius\\'s guilt or innocence, by studying Claudius\\'s reaction.\\n\\nAct III\\n\\nPolonius forces Ophelia to return Hamlet\\'s love letters and tokens of affection to the prince while he and Claudius watch from afar to evaluate Hamlet\\'s reaction. Hamlet is walking alone in the hall as the King and Polonius await Ophelia\\'s entrance, musing whether \"to be or not to be\". When Ophelia enters and tries to return Hamlet\\'s things, Hamlet accuses her of immodesty and cries \"get thee to a nunnery,\" though it is unclear whether this, too, is a show of madness or genuine distress. His reaction convinces Claudius that Hamlet is not mad for love. Shortly thereafter, the court assembles to watch the play Hamlet has commissioned. After seeing the Player King murdered by his rival pouring poison in his ear, Claudius abruptly rises and runs from the room: proof positive for Hamlet of his uncle\\'s guilt.\\n\\nGertrude summons Hamlet to her room to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has possession of his ill-gotten goods: his brother\\'s crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. Hamlet, on his way to visit his mother, sneaks up behind him, but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while the Ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen\\'s bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a tapestry, makes a noise. Hamlet, believing it is Claudius, stabs wildly, killing Polonius, but pulls aside the curtain and sees his mistake. In a rage, Hamlet brutally insults his mother for her apparent ignorance of Claudius\\'s villainy, but the Ghost enters and reprimands Hamlet for his inaction and harsh words.  Unable to see or hear the Ghost herself, Gertrude takes Hamlet\\'s conversation with it as further evidence of madness. After begging the queen to stop sleeping with Claudius, Hamlet leaves, dragging Polonius\\'s corpse away. Hamlet jokes with Claudius about where he has hidden Polonius\\'s body, and the king, fearing for his life, sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to accompany Hamlet to England with a sealed letter to the English king requesting that Hamlet be executed immediately.\\n\\nAct IV\\n\\nDemented by grief at Polonius\\'s death, Ophelia wanders Elsinore. Laertes arrives back from France, enraged by his father\\'s death and his sister\\'s madness. Claudius convinces Laertes that Hamlet is solely responsible, but a letter soon arrives indicating that Hamlet has returned to Denmark, foiling Claudius\\'s plan. Claudius switches tactics, proposing a fencing match between Laertes and Hamlet to settle their differences.  Laertes will be given a poison-tipped foil, and Claudius will offer Hamlet poisoned wine as a congratulation if that fails. Gertrude interrupts to report that Ophelia has drowned, though it is unclear whether it was suicide or an accident exacerbated by her madness.\\n\\nAct V\\n\\nHoratio has received a letter from Hamlet, explaining that the prince escaped by negotiating with pirates who attempted to attack his England-bound ship, and the friends reunite offstage. Two gravediggers discuss Ophelia\\'s apparent suicide while digging her grave.  Hamlet arrives with Horatio and banters with one of the gravediggers, who unearths the skull of a jester from Hamlet\\'s childhood, Yorick. Hamlet picks up the skull, saying \"alas, poor Yorick\" as he contemplates mortality. Ophelia\\'s funeral procession approaches, led by Laertes. Hamlet and Horatio initially hide, but when Hamlet realizes that Ophelia is the one being buried, he reveals himself, proclaiming his love for her. Laertes and Hamlet fight by Ophelia\\'s graveside, but the brawl is broken up.\\n\\nBack at Elsinore, Hamlet explains to Horatio that he had discovered Claudius\\'s letter with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\\'s belongings and replaced it with a forged copy indicating that his former friends should be killed instead. A foppish courtier, Osric, interrupts the conversation to deliver the fencing challenge to Hamlet. Hamlet, despite Horatio\\'s advice, accepts it. Hamlet does well at first, leading the match by two hits to none, and Gertrude raises a toast to him using the poisoned glass of wine Claudius had set aside for Hamlet. Claudius tries to stop her, but is too late: she drinks, and Laertes realizes the plot will be revealed. Laertes slashes Hamlet with his poisoned blade. In the ensuing scuffle, they switch weapons and Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned sword. Gertrude collapses and, claiming she has been poisoned, dies. In his dying moments, Laertes reconciles with Hamlet and reveals Claudius\\'s plan. Hamlet rushes at Claudius and kills him. As the poison takes effect, Hamlet, hearing that Fortinbras is marching through the area, names the Norwegian prince as his successor. Horatio, distraught at the thought of being the last survivor, says he will commit suicide by drinking the dregs of Gertrude\\'s poisoned wine, but Hamlet begs him to live on and tell his story. Hamlet dies, proclaiming \"the rest is silence\".  Fortinbras, who was ostensibly marching towards Poland with his army, arrives at the palace, along with an English ambassador bringing news of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\\'s deaths. Horatio promises to recount the full story of what happened, and Fortinbras, seeing the entire Danish royal family dead, takes the crown for himself.\\n\\nSources\\n\\nHamlet-like legends are so widely found (for example in Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, Byzantium, and Arabia) that the core \"hero-as-fool\" theme is possibly Indo-European in origin. Several ancient written precursors to Hamlet can be identified. The first is the anonymous Scandinavian Saga of Hrolf Kraki. In this, the murdered king has two sons—Hroar and Helgi—who spend most of the story in disguise, under false names, rather than feigning madness, in a sequence of events that differs from Shakespeare\\'s. The second is the Roman legend of Brutus, recorded in two separate Latin works. Its hero, Lucius (\"shining, light\"), changes his name and persona to Brutus (\"dull, stupid\"), playing the role of a fool to avoid the fate of his father and brothers, and eventually slaying his family\\'s killer, King Tarquinius. A 17th-century Nordic scholar, Torfaeus, compared the Icelandic hero Amlodi and the Spanish hero Prince Ambales (from the Ambales Saga) to Shakespeare\\'s Hamlet. Similarities include the prince\\'s feigned madness, his accidental killing of the king\\'s counsellor in his mother\\'s bedroom, and the eventual slaying of his uncle.\\n\\nMany of the earlier legendary elements are interwoven in the 13th-century \"Life of Amleth\" () by Saxo Grammaticus, part of Gesta Danorum. Written in Latin, it reflects classical Roman concepts of virtue and heroism, and was widely available in Shakespeare\\'s day. Significant parallels include the prince feigning madness, his mother\\'s hasty marriage to the usurper, the prince killing a hidden spy, and the prince substituting the execution of two retainers for his own. A reasonably faithful version of Saxo\\'s story was translated into French in 1570 by François de Belleforest, in his Histoires tragiques. Belleforest embellished Saxo\\'s text substantially, almost doubling its length, and introduced the hero\\'s melancholy.\\n\\nAccording to one theory, Shakespeare\\'s main source is an earlier play—now lost—known today as the Ur-Hamlet. Possibly written by Thomas Kyd or even William Shakespeare, the Ur-Hamlet would have existed by 1589, and would have incorporated a ghost. Shakespeare\\'s company, the Chamberlain\\'s Men, may have purchased that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked. However, since no copy of the Ur-Hamlet has survived, it is impossible to compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of Hamlet by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea—placing Hamlet far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development—has attracted some support.\\n\\nThe upshot is that scholars cannot assert with any confidence how much material Shakespeare took from the Ur-Hamlet (if it even existed), how much from Belleforest or Saxo, and how much from other contemporary sources (such as Kyd\\'s The Spanish Tragedy). No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare made any direct references to Saxo\\'s version. However, elements of Belleforest\\'s version which are not in Saxo\\'s story do appear in Shakespeare\\'s play. Whether Shakespeare took these from Belleforest directly or through the Ur-Hamlet remains unclear.\\n\\nMost scholars reject the idea that Hamlet is in any way connected with Shakespeare\\'s only son, Hamnet Shakespeare, who died in 1596 at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that Hamlet is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time. However, Stephen Greenblatt has argued that the coincidence of the names and Shakespeare\\'s grief for the loss of his son may lie at the heart of the tragedy. He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable.\\n\\nScholars have often speculated that Hamlets Polonius might have been inspired by William Cecil (Lord Burghley)—Lord High Treasurer and chief counsellor to Queen Elizabeth\\xa0I. E. K. Chambers suggested Polonius\\'s advice to Laertes may have echoed Burghley\\'s to his son Robert Cecil. John Dover Wilson thought it almost certain that the figure of Polonius caricatured Burghley. A. L. Rowse speculated that Polonius\\'s tedious verbosity might have resembled Burghley\\'s. Lilian Winstanley thought the name Corambis (in the First Quarto) did suggest Cecil and Burghley. Harold Jenkins considers the idea that Polonius might be a caricature of Burghley is a conjecture, and may be based on the similar role they each played at court, and also on the fact that Burghley addressed his Ten Precepts to his son, as in the play Polonius offers \"precepts\" to Laertes, his son. Jenkins suggests that any personal satire may be found in the name \"Polonius\", which might point to a Polish or Polonian connection. G. R. Hibbard hypothesised that differences in names (Corambis/Polonius:Montano/Raynoldo) between the First Quarto and other editions might reflect a desire not to offend scholars at Oxford University.\\n\\nDate\\n\\n\"Any dating of Hamlet must be tentative\", cautions the New Cambridge editor, Phillip Edwards. The earliest date estimate relies on Hamlets frequent allusions to Shakespeare\\'s Julius Caesar, itself dated to mid-1599. The latest date estimate is based on an entry, of 26 July 1602, in the Register of the Stationers\\' Company, indicating that Hamlet was \"latelie Acted by the Lo: Chamberleyne his servantes\".\\n\\nIn 1598, Francis Meres published his Palladis Tamia, a survey of English literature from Chaucer to its present day, within which twelve of Shakespeare\\'s plays are named. Hamlet is not among them, suggesting that it had not yet been written. As Hamlet was very popular, Bernard Lott, the series editor of New Swan, believes it \"unlikely that he [Meres] would have overlooked ... so significant a piece\".\\n\\nThe phrase \"little eyases\"  in the First Folio (F1) may allude to the Children of the Chapel, whose popularity in London forced the Globe company into provincial touring. This became known as the War of the Theatres, and supports a 1601 dating. Katherine Duncan-Jones accepts a 1600–1 attribution for the date Hamlet was written, but notes that the Lord Chamberlain\\'s Men, playing Hamlet in the 3000-capacity Globe, were unlikely to be put to any disadvantage by an audience of \"barely one hundred\" for the Children of the Chapel\\'s equivalent play, Antonio\\'s Revenge; she believes that Shakespeare, confident in the superiority of his own work, was making a playful and charitable allusion to his friend John Marston\\'s very similar piece.\\n\\nA contemporary of Shakespeare\\'s, Gabriel Harvey, wrote a marginal note in his copy of the 1598 edition of Chaucer\\'s works, which some scholars use as dating evidence. Harvey\\'s note says that \"the wiser sort\" enjoy Hamlet, and implies that the Earl of Essex—executed in February 1601 for rebellion—was still alive. Other scholars consider this inconclusive. Edwards, for example, concludes that the \"sense of time is so confused in Harvey\\'s note that it is really of little use in trying to date Hamlet\". This is because the same note also refers to Spenser and Watson as if they were still alive (\"our flourishing metricians\"), but also mentions \"Owen\\'s new epigrams\", published in 1607.\\n\\nTexts\\n\\nThree early editions of the text have survived, making attempts to establish a single \"authentic\" text problematic. Each is different from the others:\\n\\n*First Quarto (Q1): In 1603 the booksellers Nicholas Ling and John Trundell published, and Valentine Simmes printed, the so-called \"bad\" first quarto. Q1 contains just over half of the text of the later second quarto.\\n*Second Quarto (Q2): In 1604 Nicholas Ling published, and James Roberts printed, the second quarto. Some copies are dated 1605, which may indicate a second impression; consequently, Q2 is often dated \"1604/5\". Q2 is the longest early edition, although it omits about 77 lines found in F1 (most likely to avoid offending James I\\'s queen, Anne of Denmark).\\n*First Folio (F1): In 1623 Edward Blount and William and Isaac Jaggard published the First Folio, the first edition of Shakespeare\\'s Complete Works.\\n\\nOther folios and quartos were subsequently published—including John Smethwick\\'s Q3, Q4, and Q5 (1611–37)—but these are regarded as derivatives of the first three editions.\\n\\nEarly editors of Shakespeare\\'s works, beginning with Nicholas Rowe (1709) and Lewis Theobald (1733), combined material from the two earliest sources of Hamlet available at the time, Q2 and F1. Each text contains material that the other lacks, with many minor differences in wording: scarcely 200 lines are identical in the two. Editors have combined them in an effort to create one \"inclusive\" text that reflects an imagined \"ideal\" of Shakespeare\\'s original. Theobald\\'s version became standard for a long time, and his \"full text\" approach continues to influence editorial practice to the present day. Some contemporary scholarship, however, discounts this approach, instead considering \"an authentic Hamlet an unrealisable ideal. ... there are texts of this play but no text\". The 2006 publication by Arden Shakespeare of different Hamlet texts in different volumes is perhaps evidence of this shifting focus and emphasis. Other editors have continued to argue the need for well-edited editions taking material from all versions of the play. Colin Burrow has argued that \"most of us should read a text that is made up by conflating all three versions...it\\'s about as likely that Shakespeare wrote: \"To be or not to be, ay, there\\'s the point\" [in Q1], as that he wrote the works of Francis Bacon. I suspect most people just won\\'t want to read a three-text play...[multi-text editions are] a version of the play that is out of touch with the needs of a wider public.\"\\n\\nTraditionally, editors of Shakespeare\\'s plays have divided them into five acts. None of the early texts of Hamlet, however, were arranged this way, and the play\\'s division into acts and scenes derives from a 1676 quarto. Modern editors generally follow this traditional division, but consider it unsatisfactory; for example, after Hamlet drags Polonius\\'s body out of Gertrude\\'s bedchamber, there is an act-break  after which the action appears to continue uninterrupted.\\n\\nThe discovery in 1823 of Q1—whose existence had been quite unsuspected—caused considerable interest and excitement, raising many questions of editorial practice and interpretation. Scholars immediately identified apparent deficiencies in Q1, which was instrumental in the development of the concept of a Shakespearean \"bad quarto\". Yet Q1 has value: it contains stage directions (such as Ophelia entering with a lute and her hair down) that reveal actual stage practices in a way that Q2 and F1 do not; it contains an entire scene (usually labelled 4.6)  that does not appear in either Q2 or F1; and it is useful for comparison with the later editions. The major deficiency of Q1 is in the language: particularly noticeable in the opening lines of the famous \"To be, or not to be\" soliloquy: \"To be, or not to be, aye there\\'s the point. / To die, to sleep, is that all? Aye all: / No, to sleep, to dream, aye marry there it goes.\" However, the scene order is more coherent, without the problems of Q2 and F1 of Hamlet seeming to resolve something in one scene and enter the next drowning in indecision. New Cambridge editor Kathleen Irace has noted that \"Q1\\'s more linear plot design is certainly easier […] to follow […] but the simplicity of the Q1 plot arrangement eliminates the alternating plot elements that correspond to Hamlet\\'s shifts in mood.\"\\n\\nQ1 is considerably shorter than Q2 or F1 and may be a memorial reconstruction of the play as Shakespeare\\'s company performed it, by an actor who played a minor role (most likely Marcellus). Scholars disagree whether the reconstruction was pirated or authorised. It is suggested by Irace that Q1 is an abridged version intended especially for travelling productions, thus the question of length may be considered as separate from issues of poor textual quality. Editing Q1 thus poses problems in whether or not to \"correct\" differences from Q2 and F. Irace, in her introduction to Q1, wrote that \"I have avoided as many other alterations as possible, because the differences...are especially intriguing...I have recorded a selection of Q2/F readings in the collation.\" The idea that Q1 is not riddled with error but is instead eminently fit for the stage has led to at least 28 different Q1 productions since 1881. Other productions have used the probably superior Q2 and Folio texts, but used Q1\\'s running order, in particular moving the to be or not to be soliloquy earlier. Developing this, some editors such as Jonathan Bate have argued that Q2 may represent \"a \\'reading\\' text as opposed to a \\'performance\\' one\" of Hamlet, analogous to how modern films released on disc may include deleted scenes: an edition containing all of Shakespeare\\'s material for the play for the pleasure of readers, so not representing the play as it would have been staged.\\n\\nAnalysis and criticism\\n\\nCritical history\\n\\nFrom the early 17th century, the play was famous for its ghost and vivid dramatisation of melancholy and insanity, leading to a procession of mad courtiers and ladies in Jacobean and Caroline drama. Though it remained popular with mass audiences, late 17th-century Restoration critics saw Hamlet as primitive and disapproved of its lack of unity and decorum. This view changed drastically in the 18th century, when critics regarded Hamlet as a hero—a pure, brilliant young man thrust into unfortunate circumstances. By the mid-18th century, however, the advent of Gothic literature brought psychological and mystical readings, returning madness and the Ghost to the forefront. Not until the late 18th century did critics and performers begin to view Hamlet as confusing and inconsistent. Before then, he was either mad, or not; either a hero, or not; with no in-betweens. These developments represented a fundamental change in literary criticism, which came to focus more on character and less on plot. By the 19th century, Romantic critics valued Hamlet for its internal, individual conflict reflecting the strong contemporary emphasis on internal struggles and inner character in general. Then too, critics started to focus on Hamlet\\'s delay as a character trait, rather than a plot device. This focus on character and internal struggle continued into the 20th century, when criticism branched in several directions, discussed in context and interpretation below.\\n\\nDramatic structure\\n\\nHamlet departed from contemporary dramatic convention in several ways. For example, in Shakespeare\\'s day, plays were usually expected to follow the advice of Aristotle in his Poetics: that a drama should focus on action, not character. In Hamlet, Shakespeare reverses this so that it is through the soliloquies, not the action, that the audience learns Hamlet\\'s motives and thoughts. The play is full of seeming discontinuities and irregularities of action, except in the \"bad\" quarto. At one point, as in the Gravedigger scene, Hamlet seems resolved to kill Claudius: in the next scene, however, when Claudius appears, he is suddenly tame. Scholars still debate whether these twists are mistakes or intentional additions to add to the play\\'s themes of confusion and duality. Finally, in a period when most plays ran for two hours or so, the full text of Hamlet—Shakespeare\\'s longest play, with 4,042 lines, totalling 29,551 words—often takes over four hours to deliver. Even today the play is rarely performed in its entirety, and has only once been dramatised on film completely, in Kenneth Branagh\\'s 1996 version. Hamlet also contains a favourite Shakespearean device, a play within the play, a literary device or conceit in which one story is told during the action of another story.\\n\\nLanguage\\n\\nMuch of Hamlets language is courtly: elaborate, witty discourse, as recommended by Baldassare Castiglione\\'s 1528 etiquette guide, The Courtier. This work specifically advises royal retainers to amuse their masters with inventive language. Osric and Polonius, especially, seem to respect this injunction. Claudius\\'s speech is rich with rhetorical figures—as is Hamlet\\'s and, at times, Ophelia\\'s—while the language of Horatio, the guards, and the gravediggers is simpler. Claudius\\'s high status is reinforced by using the royal first person plural (\"we\" or \"us\"), and anaphora mixed with metaphor to resonate with Greek political speeches.\\n\\nHamlet is the most skilled of all at rhetoric. He uses highly developed metaphors, stichomythia, and in nine memorable words deploys both anaphora and asyndeton: \"to die: to sleep—\\xa0/ To sleep, perchance to dream\".  In contrast, when occasion demands, he is precise and straightforward, as when he explains his inward emotion to his mother: \"But I have that within which passes show,\\xa0/ These but the trappings and the suits of woe\".  At times, he relies heavily on puns to express his true thoughts while simultaneously concealing them. His \"nunnery\" remarks to Ophelia are an example of a cruel double meaning as nunnery was Elizabethan slang for brothel. His very first words in the play are a pun; when Claudius addresses him as \"my cousin Hamlet, and my son\", Hamlet says as an aside: \"A little more than kin, and less than kind.\" \\n\\nAn unusual rhetorical device, hendiadys, appears in several places in the play. Examples are found in Ophelia\\'s speech at the end of the nunnery scene: \"Thexpectancy and rose of the fair state\"  and \"And I, of ladies most deject and wretched\".  Many scholars have found it odd that Shakespeare would, seemingly arbitrarily, use this rhetorical form throughout the play. One explanation may be that Hamlet was written later in Shakespeare\\'s life, when he was adept at matching rhetorical devices to characters and the plot. Linguist George T. Wright suggests that hendiadys had been used deliberately to heighten the play\\'s sense of duality and dislocation. Pauline Kiernan argues that Shakespeare changed English drama forever in Hamlet because he \"showed how a character\\'s language can often be saying several things at once, and contradictory meanings at that, to reflect fragmented thoughts and disturbed feelings\". She gives the example of Hamlet\\'s advice to Ophelia, \"get thee to a nunnery\", which is simultaneously a reference to a place of chastity and a slang term for a brothel, reflecting Hamlet\\'s confused feelings about female sexuality.\\n\\nHamlet\\'s soliloquies have also captured the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly and instead blunts the thrust of his thought with wordplay. It is not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, that Hamlet is able to articulate his feelings freely.\\n\\nContext and interpretation\\n\\nReligious\\n\\nWritten at a time of religious upheaval, and in the wake of the English Reformation, the play is alternately Catholic (or piously medieval) and Protestant (or consciously modern). The Ghost describes himself as being in purgatory, and as dying without last rites. This and Ophelia\\'s burial ceremony, which is characteristically Catholic, make up most of the play\\'s Catholic connections. Some scholars have observed that revenge tragedies come from traditionally Catholic countries, such as Spain and Italy; and they present a contradiction, since according to Catholic doctrine the strongest duty is to God and family. Hamlet\\'s conundrum, then, is whether to avenge his father and kill Claudius, or to leave the vengeance to God, as his religion requires.\\n\\nMuch of the play\\'s Protestantism derives from its location in Denmark—both then and now a predominantly Protestant country, though it is unclear whether the fictional Denmark of the play is intended to mirror this fact. The play does mention Wittenberg, where Hamlet, Horatio, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern attend university, and where Martin Luther first proposed his 95 theses in 1517, effectively ushering in the Protestant Reformation.\\n\\nPhilosophical\\n\\nHamlet is often perceived as a philosophical character, expounding ideas that are now described as relativist, existentialist, and sceptical. For example, he expresses a subjectivistic idea when he says to Rosencrantz: \"there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so\".  The idea that nothing is real except in the mind of the individual finds its roots in the Greek Sophists, who argued that since nothing can be perceived except through the senses—and since all individuals sense, and therefore perceive things differently—there is no absolute truth, but rather only relative truth. The clearest alleged instance of existentialism is in the \"to be, or not to be\"  speech, where Hamlet is thought by some to use \"being\" to allude to life and action, and \"not being\" to death and inaction.\\n\\nHamlet reflects the contemporary scepticism promoted by the French Renaissance humanist Michel de Montaigne. Prior to Montaigne\\'s time, humanists such as Pico della Mirandola had argued that man was God\\'s greatest creation, made in God\\'s image and able to choose his own nature, but this view was subsequently challenged in Montaigne\\'s Essais of 1580. Hamlet\\'s \"What a piece of work is a man\" could supposedly echo many of Montaigne\\'s ideas, and many scholars have disagreed on whether Shakespeare drew directly from Montaigne or whether both men were simply reacting similarly to the spirit of the times.\\n\\nPsychoanalytic\\n\\nIn the first half of the 20th century, when psychoanalysis was at the height of its influence, its concepts were applied to Hamlet, notably by Sigmund Freud, Ernest Jones, and Jacques Lacan, and these studies influenced theatrical productions. In his The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), Freud\\'s analysis starts from the premise that \"the play is built up on Hamlet\\'s hesitations over fulfilling the task of revenge that is assigned to him; but its text offers no reasons or motives for these hesitations\". After reviewing various literary theories, Freud concludes that Hamlet has an \"Oedipal desire for his mother and the subsequent guilt [is] preventing him from murdering the man [Claudius] who has done what he unconsciously wanted to do\". Confronted with his repressed desires, Hamlet realises that \"he himself is literally no better than the sinner whom he is to punish\". Freud suggests that Hamlet\\'s apparent \"distaste for sexuality\"—articulated in his \"nunnery\" conversation with Ophelia—accords with this interpretation. John Barrymore\\'s long-running 1922 performance in New York, directed by Thomas Hopkins, \"broke new ground in its Freudian approach to character\", in keeping with the post-World War I rebellion against everything Victorian. He had a \"blunter intention\" than presenting the genteel, sweet prince of 19th-century tradition, imbuing his character with virility and lust.\\n\\nBeginning in 1910, with the publication of \"The Œdipus-Complex as an Explanation of Hamlet\\'s Mystery: A Study in Motive\" Ernest Jones—a psychoanalyst and Freud\\'s biographer—developed Freud\\'s ideas into a series of essays that culminated in his book Hamlet and Oedipus (1949). Influenced by Jones\\'s psychoanalytic approach, several productions have portrayed the \"closet scene\", where Hamlet confronts his mother in her private quarters, in a sexual light. In this reading, Hamlet is disgusted by his mother\\'s \"incestuous\" relationship with Claudius while simultaneously fearful of killing him, as this would clear Hamlet\\'s path to his mother\\'s bed. Ophelia\\'s madness after her father\\'s death may also be read through the Freudian lens: as a reaction to the death of her hoped-for lover, her father. She is overwhelmed by having her unfulfilled love for him so abruptly terminated and drifts into the oblivion of insanity. In 1937, Tyrone Guthrie directed Laurence Olivier in a Jones-inspired Hamlet at The Old Vic. Olivier later used some of these same ideas in his 1948 film version of the play.\\n\\nIn the 1950s, Lacan\\'s structuralist theories about Hamlet were first presented in a series of seminars given in Paris and later published in \"Desire and the Interpretation of Desire in Hamlet\". Lacan postulated that the human psyche is determined by structures of language and that the linguistic structures of Hamlet shed light on human desire. His point of departure is Freud\\'s Oedipal theories, and the central theme of mourning that runs through Hamlet. In Lacan\\'s analysis, Hamlet unconsciously assumes the role of phallus—the cause of his inaction—and is increasingly distanced from reality \"by mourning, fantasy, narcissism and psychosis\", which create holes (or lack) in the real, imaginary, and symbolic aspects of his psyche. Lacan\\'s theories influenced literary criticism of Hamlet because of his alternative vision of the play and his use of semantics to explore the play\\'s psychological landscape.\\n\\nIn the Bloom\\'s Shakespeare Through the Ages volume on Hamlet, editors Bloom and Foster express a conviction that the intentions of Shakespeare in portraying the character of Hamlet in the play exceeded the capacity of the Freudian Oedipus complex to completely encompass the extent of characteristics depicted in Hamlet throughout the tragedy: \"For once, Freud regressed in attempting to fasten the Oedipus Complex upon Hamlet: it will not stick, and merely showed that Freud did better than T.S. Eliot, who preferred Coriolanus to Hamlet, or so he said. Who can believe Eliot, when he exposes his own Hamlet Complex by declaring the play to be an aesthetic failure?\" The book also notes James Joyce\\'s interpretation, stating that he \"did far better in the Library Scene of Ulysses, where Stephen marvelously credits Shakespeare, in this play, with universal fatherhood while accurately implying that Hamlet is fatherless, thus opening a pragmatic gap between Shakespeare and Hamlet.\"\\n\\nJoshua Rothman has written in The New Yorker that \"we tell the story wrong when we say that Freud used the idea of the Oedipus complex to understand Hamlet\". Rothman suggests that \"it was the other way around: Hamlet helped Freud understand, and perhaps even invent, psychoanalysis\". He concludes, \"The Oedipus complex is a misnomer. It should be called the \\'Hamlet complex\\'.\"\\n\\nIn the essay \"Hamlet Made Simple\", David P. Gontar turns the tables on the psychoanalysts by suggesting that Claudius is not a symbolic father figure but actually Prince Hamlet\\'s biological father.  The hesitation in killing Claudius results from an unwillingness on Hamlet\\'s part to slay his real father.  If Hamlet is the biological son of Claudius, that explains many things.  Hamlet doesn\\'t become King of Denmark on the occasion of the King\\'s death inasmuch as it is an open secret in court that he is Claudius\\'s biological son, and as such he is merely a court bastard not in the line of succession.  He is angry with his mother because of her long standing affair with a man Hamlet hates, and Hamlet must face the fact that he has been sired by the man he loathes.  That point overturns T. S. Eliot\\'s complaint that the play is a failure for not furnishing an \"objective correlative\" to account for Hamlet\\'s rage at his mother.  Gontar suggests that if the reader assumes that Hamlet is not who he seems to be, the objective correlative becomes apparent.  Hamlet is suicidal in the first soliloquy not because his mother quickly remarries but because of her adulterous affair with the despised Claudius which makes Hamlet his son.  Finally, the Ghost\\'s confirmation of an alternative fatherhood for Hamlet is a fabrication that gives the Prince a motive for revenge.\\n\\nFeminist\\n\\nIn the 20th century, feminist critics opened up new approaches to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character\\'s changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, can be seen as honest and fair; however, it is virtually impossible to link these two traits, since \\'fairness\\' is an outward trait, while \\'honesty\\' is an inward trait.\\n\\nCarolyn Heilbrun\\'s 1957 essay \"The Character of Hamlet\\'s Mother\" defends Gertrude, arguing that the text never hints that Gertrude knew of Claudius poisoning King Hamlet. This analysis has been praised by many feminist critics, combating what is, by Heilbrun\\'s argument, centuries\\' worth of misinterpretation. By this account, Gertrude\\'s worst crime is of pragmatically marrying her brother-in-law in order to avoid a power vacuum. This is borne out by the fact that King Hamlet\\'s ghost tells Hamlet to leave Gertrude out of Hamlet\\'s revenge, to leave her to heaven, an arbitrary mercy to grant to a conspirator to murder. This view has not been without objection from some critics.\\n\\nOphelia has also been defended by feminist critics, most notably Elaine Showalter. Ophelia is surrounded by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia is driven into madness. Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have Hamlet kill her father so they can be together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture.\\n\\nInfluence\\n\\nSee also Literary influence of Hamlet\\n\\nHamlet is one of the most quoted works in the English language, and is often included on lists of the world\\'s greatest literature. As such, it reverberates through the writing of later centuries. Academic Laurie Osborne identifies the direct influence of Hamlet in numerous modern narratives, and divides them into four main categories: fictional accounts of the play\\'s composition, simplifications of the story for young readers, stories expanding the role of one or more characters, and narratives featuring performances of the play.\\n\\nHenry Fielding\\'s Tom Jones, published about 1749, describes a visit to Hamlet by Tom Jones and Mr Partridge, with similarities to the \"play within a play\". In contrast, Goethe\\'s Bildungsroman Wilhelm Meister\\'s Apprenticeship, written between 1776 and 1796, not only has a production of Hamlet at its core but also creates parallels between the Ghost and Wilhelm Meister\\'s dead father. In the early 1850s, in Pierre, Herman Melville focuses on a Hamlet-like character\\'s long development as a writer. Ten years later, Dickens\\'s Great Expectations contains many Hamlet-like plot elements: it is driven by revenge-motivated actions, contains ghost-like characters (Abel Magwitch and Miss Havisham), and focuses on the hero\\'s guilt. Academic Alexander Welsh notes that Great Expectations is an \"autobiographical novel\" and \"anticipates psychoanalytic readings of Hamlet itself\". About the same time, George Eliot\\'s The Mill on the Floss was published, introducing Maggie Tulliver \"who is explicitly compared with Hamlet\" though \"with a reputation for sanity\".\\n\\nL. Frank Baum\\'s first published short story was \"They Played a New Hamlet\" (1895). When Baum had been touring New York State in the title role, the actor playing the ghost fell through the floorboards, and the rural audience thought it was part of the show and demanded that the actor repeat the fall, because they thought it was funny. Baum would later recount the actual story in an article, but the short story is told from the point of view of the actor playing the Ghost.\\n\\nIn the 1920s, James Joyce managed \"a more upbeat version\" of Hamlet—stripped of obsession and revenge—in Ulysses, though its main parallels are with Homer\\'s Odyssey. In the 1990s, two novelists were explicitly influenced by Hamlet. In Angela Carter\\'s Wise Children, To be or not to be  is reworked as a song and dance routine, and Iris Murdoch\\'s The Black Prince has Oedipal themes and murder intertwined with a love affair between a Hamlet-obsessed writer, Bradley Pearson, and the daughter of his rival.\\n\\nThere is the story of the woman who read Hamlet for the first time and said, \"I don\\'t see why people admire that play so. It is nothing but a bunch of quotations strung together.\"\\n\\n—Isaac Asimov, Asimov\\'s Guide to Shakespeare, pg vii, Avenal Books, 1970\\n\\nPerformance history\\n\\nShakespeare\\'s day to the Interregnum\\n\\nShakespeare almost certainly wrote the role of Hamlet for Richard Burbage. He was the chief tragedian of the Lord Chamberlain\\'s Men, with a capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range. Judging by the number of reprints, Hamlet appears to have been Shakespeare\\'s fourth most popular play during his lifetime—only Henry IV Part 1, Richard III and Pericles eclipsed it. Shakespeare provides no clear indication of when his play is set; however, as Elizabethan actors performed at the Globe in contemporary dress on minimal sets, this would not have affected the staging.\\n\\nFirm evidence for specific early performances of the play is scant. What is known is that the crew of the ship Red Dragon, anchored off Sierra Leone, performed Hamlet in September 1607; that the play toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare\\'s death; and that it was performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637. Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that, since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to Hamlet (only Falstaff is mentioned more, from Shakespeare), the play was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses.\\n\\nAll theatres were closed down by the Puritan government during the Interregnum. Even during this time, however, playlets known as drolls were often performed illegally, including one called The Grave-Makers based on Act 5, Scene 1 of Hamlet.\\n\\nRestoration and 18th century\\n\\nThe play was revived early in the Restoration. When the existing stock of pre-civil war plays was divided between the two newly created patent theatre companies, Hamlet was the only Shakespearean favourite that Sir William Davenant\\'s Duke\\'s Company secured. It became the first of Shakespeare\\'s plays to be presented with movable flats painted with generic scenery behind the proscenium arch of Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields Theatre. This new stage convention highlighted the frequency with which Shakespeare shifts dramatic location, encouraging the recurrent criticisms of his violation of the neoclassical principle of maintaining a unity of place. Davenant cast Thomas Betterton in the eponymous role, and he continued to play the Dane until he was 74. David Garrick at Drury Lane produced a version that adapted Shakespeare heavily; he declared: \"I had sworn I would not leave the stage till I had rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act. I have brought it forth without the grave-digger\\'s trick, Osrick, & the fencing match\". The first actor known to have played Hamlet in North America is Lewis Hallam. Jr., in the American Company\\'s production in Philadelphia in 1759.\\n\\nJohn Philip Kemble made his Drury Lane debut as Hamlet in 1783. His performance was said to be 20 minutes longer than anyone else\\'s, and his lengthy pauses provoked the suggestion by Richard Brinsley Sheridan that \"music should be played between the words\". Sarah Siddons was the first actress known to play Hamlet; many women have since played him as a breeches role, to great acclaim. In 1748, Alexander Sumarokov wrote a Russian adaptation that focused on Prince Hamlet as the embodiment of an opposition to Claudius\\'s tyranny—a treatment that would recur in Eastern European versions into the 20th century. In the years following America\\'s independence, Thomas Apthorpe Cooper, the young nation\\'s leading tragedian, performed Hamlet among other plays at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia, and at the Park Theatre in New York. Although chided for \"acknowledging acquaintances in the audience\" and \"inadequate memorisation of his lines\", he became a national celebrity.\\n\\n19th century\\n\\nFrom around 1810 to 1840, the best-known Shakespearean performances in the United States were tours by leading London actors—including George Frederick Cooke, Junius Brutus Booth, Edmund Kean, William Charles Macready, and Charles Kemble. Of these, Booth remained to make his career in the States, fathering the nation\\'s most notorious actor, John Wilkes Booth (who later assassinated Abraham Lincoln), and its most famous Hamlet, Edwin Booth. Edwin Booth\\'s Hamlet at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in 1875 was described as \"… the dark, sad, dreamy, mysterious hero of a poem. … [acted] in an ideal manner, as far removed as possible from the plane of actual life\". Booth played Hamlet for 100 nights in the 1864/5 season at The Winter Garden Theatre, inaugurating the era of long-run Shakespeare in America.\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, the actor-managers of the Victorian era (including Kean, Samuel Phelps, Macready, and Henry Irving) staged Shakespeare in a grand manner, with elaborate scenery and costumes. The tendency of actor-managers to emphasise the importance of their own central character did not always meet with the critics\\' approval. George Bernard Shaw\\'s praise for Johnston Forbes-Robertson\\'s performance contains a sideswipe at Irving: \"The story of the play was perfectly intelligible, and quite took the attention of the audience off the principal actor at moments. What is the Lyceum coming to?\"\\n\\nIn London, Edmund Kean was the first Hamlet to abandon the regal finery usually associated with the role in favour of a plain costume, and he is said to have surprised his audience by playing Hamlet as serious and introspective. In stark contrast to earlier opulence, William Poel\\'s 1881 production of the Q1 text was an early attempt at reconstructing the Elizabethan theatre\\'s austerity; his only backdrop was a set of red curtains. Sarah Bernhardt played the prince in her popular 1899 London production. In contrast to the \"effeminate\" view of the central character that usually accompanied a female casting, she described her character as \"manly and resolute, but nonetheless thoughtful ... [he] thinks before he acts, a trait indicative of great strength and great spiritual power\".\\n\\nIn France, Charles Kemble initiated an enthusiasm for Shakespeare; and leading members of the Romantic movement such as Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas saw his 1827 Paris performance of Hamlet, particularly admiring the madness of Harriet Smithson\\'s Ophelia. In Germany, Hamlet had become so assimilated by the mid-19th century that Ferdinand Freiligrath declared that \"Germany is Hamlet\". From the 1850s, the Parsi theatre tradition in India transformed Hamlet into folk performances, with dozens of songs added.\\n\\n20th century\\n\\nApart from some western troupes\\' 19th-century visits, the first professional performance of Hamlet in Japan was Otojirō Kawakami\\'s 1903 Shimpa (\"new school theatre\") adaptation. Shoyo Tsubouchi translated Hamlet and produced a performance in 1911 that blended Shingeki (\"new drama\") and Kabuki styles. This hybrid-genre reached its peak in Tsuneari Fukuda\\'s 1955 Hamlet. In 1998, Yukio Ninagawa produced an acclaimed version of Hamlet in the style of Nō theatre, which he took to London.\\n\\nConstantin Stanislavski and Edward Gordon Craig—two of the 20th century\\'s most influential theatre practitioners—collaborated on the Moscow Art Theatre\\'s seminal production of 1911–12. While Craig favoured stylised abstraction, Stanislavski, armed with his \\'system,\\' explored psychological motivation. Craig conceived of the play as a symbolist monodrama, offering a dream-like vision as seen through Hamlet\\'s eyes alone. This was most evident in the staging of the first court scene. The most famous aspect of the production is Craig\\'s use of large, abstract screens that altered the size and shape of the acting area for each scene, representing the character\\'s state of mind spatially or visualising a dramaturgical progression. The production attracted enthusiastic and unprecedented world-wide attention for the theatre and placed it \"on the cultural map for Western Europe\".\\n\\nHamlet is often played with contemporary political overtones. Leopold Jessner\\'s 1926 production at the Berlin Staatstheater portrayed Claudius\\'s court as a parody of the corrupt and fawning court of Kaiser Wilhelm.  In Poland, the number of productions of Hamlet has tended to increase at times of political unrest, since its political themes (suspected crimes, coups, surveillance) can be used to comment on a contemporary situation. Similarly, Czech directors have used the play at times of occupation: a 1941 Vinohrady Theatre production \"emphasised, with due caution, the helpless situation of an intellectual attempting to endure in a ruthless environment\". In China, performances of Hamlet often have political significance: Gu Wuwei\\'s 1916 The Usurper of State Power, an amalgam of Hamlet and Macbeth, was an attack on Yuan Shikai\\'s attempt to overthrow the republic. In 1942, Jiao Juyin directed the play in a Confucian temple in Sichuan Province, to which the government had retreated from the advancing Japanese. In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the protests at Tiananmen Square, Lin Zhaohua staged a 1990 Hamlet in which the prince was an ordinary individual tortured by a loss of meaning. In this production, the actors playing Hamlet, Claudius and Polonius exchanged roles at crucial moments in the performance, including the moment of Claudius\\'s death, at which point the actor mainly associated with Hamlet fell to the ground.\\n\\nNotable stagings in London and New York include Barrymore\\'s 1925 production at the Haymarket; it influenced subsequent performances by John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier. Gielgud played the central role many times: his 1936 New York production ran for 132 performances, leading to the accolade that he was \"the finest interpreter of the role since Barrymore\". Although \"posterity has treated Maurice Evans less kindly\", throughout the 1930s and 1940s he was regarded by many as the leading interpreter of Shakespeare in the United States and in the 1938/9 season he presented Broadway\\'s first uncut Hamlet, running four and a half hours. Evans later performed a highly truncated version of the play that he played for South Pacific war zones during World War II which made the prince a more decisive character. The staging, known as the \"G.I. Hamlet,\" was produced on Broadway for 131 performances in 1945/46. Olivier\\'s 1937 performance at The Old Vic was popular with audiences but not with critics, with James Agate writing in a famous review in The Sunday Times, \"Mr. Olivier does not speak poetry badly. He does not speak it at all.\". In 1937 Tyrone Guthrie directed the play at Elsinore, Denmark with Laurence Olivier as Hamlet and Vivien Leigh as Ophelia.\\n\\nIn 1963, Olivier directed Peter O\\'Toole as Hamlet in the inaugural performance of the newly formed National Theatre; critics found resonance between O\\'Toole\\'s Hamlet and John Osborne\\'s hero, Jimmy Porter, from Look Back in Anger.\\n\\nRichard Burton received his third Tony Award nomination when he played his second Hamlet, his first under John Gielgud\\'s direction, in 1964 in a production that holds the record for the longest run of the play in Broadway history (137 performances). The performance was set on a bare stage, conceived to appear like a dress rehearsal, with Burton in a black v-neck sweater, and Gielgud himself tape-recorded the voice for the Ghost (which appeared as a looming shadow). It was immortalised both on record and on a film that played in US theatres for a week in 1964 as well as being the subject of books written by cast members William Redfield and Richard L. Sterne. Other New York portrayals of Hamlet of note include that of Ralph Fiennes\\'s in 1995 (for which he won the Tony Award for Best Actor) – which ran, from first preview to closing night, a total of one hundred performances. About the Fiennes Hamlet Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times that it was \"… not one for literary sleuths and Shakespeare scholars. It respects the play, but it doesn\\'t provide any new material for arcane debates on what it all means. Instead it\\'s an intelligent, beautifully read …\" Stacy Keach played the role with an all-star cast at Joseph Papp\\'s Delacorte Theatre in the early 70s, with Colleen Dewhurst\\'s Gertrude, James Earl Jones\\'s King, Barnard Hughes\\'s Polonius, Sam Waterston\\'s Laertes and Raúl Juliá\\'s Osric. Sam Waterston later played the role himself at the Delacorte for the New York Shakespeare Festival, and the show transferred to the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in 1975 (Stephen Lang played Bernardo and other roles). Stephen Lang\\'s Hamlet for the Roundabout Theatre Company in 1992 received mixed reviews and ran for sixty-one performances. David Warner played the role with the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1965. William Hurt (at Circle Rep Off-Broadway, memorably performing \"To Be Or Not to Be\" while lying on the floor), Jon Voight at Rutgers, and Christopher Walken (fiercely) at Stratford CT have all played the role, as has Diane Venora at the Public Theatre. Off Broadway, the Riverside Shakespeare Company mounted an uncut first folio Hamlet in 1978 at Columbia University, with a playing time of under three hours. In fact, Hamlet is the most produced Shakespeare play in New York theatre history, with sixty-four recorded productions on Broadway, and an untold number Off Broadway.\\n\\nIan Charleson performed Hamlet from 9 October to 13 November 1989, in Richard Eyre\\'s production at the Olivier Theatre, replacing Daniel Day-Lewis, who had abandoned the production. Seriously ill from AIDS at the time, Charleson died eight weeks after his last performance. Fellow actor and friend, Sir Ian McKellen, said that Charleson played Hamlet so well it was as if he had rehearsed the role all his life; McKellen called it \"the perfect Hamlet\". The performance garnered other major accolades as well, some critics echoing McKellen in calling it the definitive Hamlet performance.\\n\\n21st century\\n\\nHamlet continues to be staged regularly, with actors such as Simon Russell Beale, Ben Whishaw, David Tennant, Angela Winkler, Samuel West, Christopher Eccleston, Maxine Peake, Rory Kinnear, Christian Camargo and Andrew Scott, performing the lead role.\\n\\nIn May 2009, Hamlet opened with Jude Law in the title role at the Donmar Warehouse West End season at Wyndham\\'s Theatre. The production officially opened on 3 June and ran through 22 August 2009. A further production of the play ran at Elsinore Castle in Denmark from 25–30 August 2009. The Jude Law Hamlet then moved to Broadway, and ran for 12 weeks at the Broadhurst Theatre in New York.\\n\\nIn 2013, American actor Paul Giamatti won critical acclaim for his performance on stage in the title role of Hamlet, performed in modern dress, at the Yale Repertory Theater, at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.\\n\\nThe Globe Theatre of London initiated a project in 2014 to perform Hamlet in every country in the world in the space of two years. Titled Globe to Globe Hamlet, it began its tour on 23 April 2014, the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare\\'s birth. As of 23 February 2016, the project had performed in 170 different countries.\\n\\nBenedict Cumberbatch played the role for a 12-week run in a production at the Barbican Theatre, opening on 25 August 2015. The play was produced by Sonia Friedman, and directed by Lyndsey Turner, with set design by Es Devlin. It was called the \"most in-demand theatre production of all time\". The entire run sold out in seven hours after tickets went on sale 11 August 2014, more than a year before the play opened.\\n\\nFilm and TV performances\\n\\nThe earliest screen success for Hamlet was Sarah Bernhardt\\'s five-minute film of the fencing scene, which was produced in 1900. The film was an early attempt at combining  sound and film, music and words were recorded on phonograph records, to be played along with the film. Silent versions were released in 1907, 1908, 1910, 1913, 1917, and 1920. In the 1920 version, Asta Nielsen played the role of Hamlet as a woman who spends her life disguised as a man.\\n\\nLaurence Olivier\\'s 1948 moody black-and-white Hamlet won best picture and best actor Oscars, and is still, , the only Shakespeare film to have done so. His interpretation stressed the Oedipal overtones of the play, and cast 28-year-old Eileen Herlie as Hamlet\\'s mother, opposite himself, at 41, as Hamlet. In 1953, actor Jack Manning performed the play in 15-minute segments over two weeks in the short-lived late night DuMont series Monodrama Theater. New York Times TV critic Jack Gould praised Manning\\'s performance as Hamlet.\\n\\nShakespeare experts Sir John Gielgud and Kenneth Branagh consider the definitive rendition of the Bard\\'s tragic tale to be the 1964 Russian film Gamlet () based on a translation by Boris Pasternak and directed by Grigori Kozintsev, with a score by Dmitri Shostakovich. Innokenty Smoktunovsky was cast in the role of Hamlet; he was particularly praised by Sir Laurence Olivier.\\n\\nJohn Gielgud directed Richard Burton in a Broadway production at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in 1964–5, the longest-running Hamlet in the U.S. to date. A live film of the production was produced using \"Electronovision\", a method of recording a live performance with multiple video cameras and converting the image to film. Eileen Herlie repeated her role from Olivier\\'s film version as the Queen, and the voice of Gielgud was heard as the Ghost. The Gielgud/Burton production was also recorded complete and released on LP by Columbia Masterworks.\\n\\nThe first Hamlet in color was a 1969 film directed by Tony Richardson with Nicol Williamson as Hamlet and Marianne Faithfull as Ophelia.\\n\\nIn 1990 Franco Zeffirelli, whose Shakespeare films have been described as \"sensual rather than cerebral\", cast Mel Gibson—then famous for the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon movies—in the title role of his 1990 version; Glenn Close—then famous as the psychotic \"other woman\" in Fatal Attraction—played Gertrude, and Paul Scofield played Hamlet\\'s father. In contrast to Zeffirelli, whose Hamlet was heavily cut, Kenneth Branagh adapted, directed, and starred in a 1996 version containing every word of Shakespeare\\'s play, combining the material from the F1 and Q2 texts. Branagh\\'s Hamlet runs for around four hours. Branagh set the film with late 19th-century costuming and furnishings; and Blenheim Palace, built in the early 18th century, became Elsinore Castle in the external scenes. The film is structured as an epic and makes frequent use of flashbacks to highlight elements not made explicit in the play: Hamlet\\'s sexual relationship with Kate Winslet\\'s Ophelia, for example, or his childhood affection for Yorick (played by Ken Dodd).\\n\\nIn 2000, Michael Almereyda\\'s Hamlet set the story in contemporary Manhattan, with Ethan Hawke playing Hamlet as a film student. Claudius (played by Kyle MacLachlan) became the CEO of \"Denmark Corporation\", having taken over the company by killing his brother.\\n\\nNotable made-for-television productions of Hamlet include those starring Christopher Plummer (1964), Richard Chamberlain (1970; Hallmark Hall of Fame), Derek Jacobi (1980; Royal Shakespeare Company, BBC), Kevin Kline (1990), Campbell Scott (2000) and David Tennant (2009; Royal Shakespeare Company, BBC).\\n\\nThere have also been several films that transposed the general storyline of Hamlet or elements thereof to other settings. There have also been many films which included performances of scenes from Hamlet as a play-within-a-film.\\n\\nStage pastiches\\n\\nThere have been various \"derivative works\" of Hamlet which recast the story from the point of view of other characters, or transpose the story into a new setting or act as sequels or prequels to Hamlet. This section is limited to those written for the stage.\\n\\nThe best-known is Tom Stoppard\\'s 1966 play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, which retells many of the events of the story from the point of view of the characters Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and gives them a backstory of their own. Several times since 1995, the American Shakespeare Center has mounted repertories that included both Hamlet and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, with the same actors performing the same roles in each; in their 2001 and 2009 seasons the two plays were \"directed, designed, and rehearsed together to make the most out of the shared scenes and situations\".\\n\\nW.S. Gilbert wrote a short comic play titled Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, in Hamlet\\'s play is presented as a tragedy written by Claudius in his youth of which he is greatly embarrassed. Through the chaos triggered by Hamlet\\'s staging of it, Guildenstern helps Rosencrantz vie with Hamlet to make Ophelia his bride.\\n\\nLee Blessing\\'s Fortinbras is a comical sequel to Hamlet in which all the deceased characters come back as ghosts. The New York Times reviewed the play, saying it is \"scarcely more than an extended comedy sketch, lacking the portent and linguistic complexity of Tom Stoppard\\'s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. Fortinbras operates on a far less ambitious plane, but it is a ripping yarn and offers Keith Reddin a role in which he can commit comic mayhem.\"\\n\\nHeiner Müller\\'s postmodern drama The Hamletmachine was first produced in Paris by director Jean Jourdheuil in 1979. This play in turn inspired Giannina Braschi\\'s dramatic novel United States of Banana, which takes place at the Statue of Liberty in post-9/11 New York City. In it, Hamlet, Zarathustra, and Giannina are on a quest to free the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo from the dungeon of Liberty, where Segismundo\\'s father, Basilio, the King of the United States of Banana, imprisoned him for the crime of having been born. The work intertwines the plots and characters of Pedro Calderón de la Barca\\'s Life Is a Dream with Shakespeare\\'s Hamlet.\\n\\nCaridad Svich\\'s 12 Ophelias (a play with broken songs) includes elements of the story of Hamlet but focuses on Ophelia. In Svich\\'s play, Ophelia is resurrected and rises from a pool of water, after her death in Hamlet. The play is a series of scenes and songs, and was first staged at public swimming pool in Brooklyn. Heidi Weiss of the Chicago Sun-Times said of the play, \"Far more surreal and twisted than Tom Stoppard\\'s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, 12 Ophelias is a reminder of just how morphable and mysterious Shakespeare\\'s original remains.\" Other characters are renamed: Hamlet is Rude Boy, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are androgynous helpers known simply as R and G, Gertrude is the madam of a brothel, Horatio becomes H and continues to be Hamlet\\'s best friend/confidante, and a chorus of Ophelias serves as guide. A new character, Mina, is introduced, and she is a whore in Gertrude\\'s brothel.\\n\\nDavid Davalos\\' Wittenberg is a \"tragical-comical-historical\" prequel to Hamlet that depicts the Danish prince as a student at Wittenberg University (now known as the University of Halle-Wittenberg), where he is torn between the conflicting teachings of his mentors John Faustus and Martin Luther. The New York Times reviewed the play, saying, \"Mr. Davalos has molded a daft campus comedy out of this unlikely convergence,\" and nytheatres review said the playwright \"has imagined a fascinating alternate reality, and quite possibly, given the fictional Hamlet a back story that will inform the role for the future.\"',\n",
              "   'William Shakespeare (;  26 April 1564 (baptised)\\xa0– 23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world\\'s pre-eminent dramatist.; ; . He is often called England\\'s national poet, and the \"Bard of Avon\".  His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. \\n\\nShakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain\\'s Men, later known as the King\\'s Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare\\'s private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, and religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. \\n\\nShakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613.  His early plays were primarily comedies and histories, and these are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights.\\n\\nMany of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, however, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare\\'s. It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Shakespeare is hailed, presciently, as \"not of an age, but for all time\".The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century, Volume B, 2012, pg. 1168 \\n\\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, his works have been repeatedly adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular, and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.\\n\\nLife\\n\\nEarly life\\n\\nWilliam Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer.  He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26\\xa0April 1564. His actual date of birth remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23\\xa0April, Saint George\\'s Day.  This date, which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar\\'s mistake, has proved appealing to biographers, because Shakespeare died on 23\\xa0April 1616.  He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son. \\n\\nAlthough no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King\\'s New School in Stratford,  a free school chartered in 1553,  about a quarter-mile (400\\xa0m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree,  and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors. \\n\\nAt the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27\\xa0November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway\\'s neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage.  The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste, since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times,  and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583.  Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585.  Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11\\xa0August 1596. \\n\\nAfter the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance of his name in the \"complaints bill\" of a law case before the Queen\\'s Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October 1589.  Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare\\'s \"lost years\".  Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories. Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare\\'s first biographer, recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy. Shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him.  Another 18th-century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London.  John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster.  Some 20th-century scholars have suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire, a Catholic landowner who named a certain \"William Shakeshafte\" in his will.  Little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death, and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area. \\n\\nLondon and theatrical career\\n\\nIt is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592.  By then, he was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his Groats-Worth of Wit:\\n\\n...\\xa0there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tiger\\'s heart wrapped in a Player\\'s hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute Johannes factotum, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country. \\n\\nScholars differ on the exact meaning of Greene\\'s words,; . but most agree that Greene is accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe and Greene himself (the so-called \"university wits\").  The italicised phrase parodying the line \"Oh, tiger\\'s heart wrapped in a woman\\'s hide\" from Shakespeare\\'s Henry VI, Part 3, along with the pun \"Shake-scene\", clearly identify Shakespeare as Greene\\'s target. As used here, Johannes Factotum (\"Jack of all trades\") refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common \"universal genius\". \\n\\nGreene\\'s attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare\\'s work in the theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s, to just before Greene\\'s remarks.  After 1594, Shakespeare\\'s plays were performed only by the Lord Chamberlain\\'s Men, a company owned by a group of players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in London.  After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new King James I, and changed its name to the King\\'s Men. \\n\\nIn 1599, a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Extant records of Shakespeare\\'s property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man,  and in 1597 he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford. \\n\\nSome of Shakespeare\\'s plays were published in quarto editions beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages.  Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson\\'s Works names him on the cast lists for Every Man in His Humour (1598) and Sejanus His Fall (1603).  The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson\\'s Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end.  The First Folio of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one of \"the Principal Actors in all these Plays\", some of which were first staged after Volpone, although we cannot know for certain which roles he played.  In 1610, John Davies of Hereford wrote that \"good Will\" played \"kingly\" roles.  In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet\\'s father.  Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in As You Like It, and the Chorus in Henry V,  though scholars doubt the sources of that information. \\n\\nThroughout his career, Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford. In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St. Helen\\'s, Bishopsgate, north of the River Thames.  He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the same year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there.  By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of St Paul\\'s Cathedral with many fine houses. There he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of ladies\\' wigs and other headgear. \\n\\nLater years and death\\n\\nRowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford \"some years before his death\".. He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an answer to the sharers\\' petition in 1635 Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King\\'s Men \"placed men players\" there, \"which were Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, etc.\". However it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609. The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610),  which meant there was often no acting work. Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time.  Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 1611–1614. In 1612, he was called as a witness in Bellott v. Mountjoy, a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy\\'s daughter, Mary.  In March 1613 he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory;  and from November 1614 he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law, John Hall.  After 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613.  His last three plays were collaborations, probably with John Fletcher,  who succeeded him as the house playwright of the King\\'s Men. \\n\\nShakespeare died on 23 April 1616, at the age of 52.  He died within a month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself as being in \"perfect health\". No extant contemporary source explains how or why he died. Half a century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in his notebook: \"Shakespeare, Drayton and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted\",   not an impossible scenario, since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death: \"We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went\\'st so soon/From the world\\'s stage to the grave\\'s tiring room.\" \\n\\nHe was survived by his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607,  and Judith had married Thomas Quiney, a vintner, two months before Shakespeare\\'s death. \\nShakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 March 1616; the following day his new son-in-law, Thomas Quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler, who had died during childbirth. Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family. \\n\\nShakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna  under stipulations that she pass it down intact to \"the first son of her body\".  The Quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying.  The Halls had one child, Elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending Shakespeare\\'s direct line.  Shakespeare\\'s will scarcely mentions his wife, Anne, who was probably entitled to one third of his estate automatically.  He did make a point, however, of leaving her \"my second best bed\", a bequest that has led to much speculation.  Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne, whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance. \\n\\nShakespeare was buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church two days after his death.  The epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones, which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008: \\n\\nGood frend for Iesvs sake forbeare,\\nTo digg the dvst encloased heare.\\nBleste be  man  spares thes stones,\\nAnd cvrst be he  moves my bones. \\n\\n(Modern spelling: Good friend, for Jesus\\' sake forbear, / To dig the dust enclosed here. / Blessed be the man that spares these stones, / And cursed be he that moves my bones.)\\n\\nSometime before 1623, a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall, with a half-effigy of him in the act of writing. Its plaque compares him to Nestor, Socrates, and Virgil.  In 1623, in conjunction with the publication of the First Folio, the Droeshout engraving was published. \\n\\nShakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world, including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets\\' Corner in Westminster Abbey.  \\n\\nPlays\\n\\nMost playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, and critics agree that Shakespeare did the same, mostly early and late in his career.  Some attributions, such as Titus Andronicus and the early history plays, remain controversial, while The Two Noble Kinsmen and the lost Cardenio have well-attested contemporary documentation. Textual evidence also supports the view that several of the plays were revised by other writers after their original composition.\\n\\nThe first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI, written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare\\'s plays are difficult to date, however,  and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus, The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare\\'s earliest period.  His first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed\\'s Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland,  dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty.  The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of Seneca.  The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models, but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story.  Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona, in which two friends appear to approve of rape,  the Shrew\\'s story of the taming of a woman\\'s independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics and directors. \\n\\nShakespeare\\'s early classical and Italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies.  A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes.  Shakespeare\\'s next comedy, the equally romantic Merchant of Venice, contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock, which reflects Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences.  The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing,  the charming rural setting of As You Like It, and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare\\'s sequence of great comedies.  After the lyrical Richard II, written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, Henry IV, parts 1 and 2, and Henry V. His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work.  This period begins and ends with two tragedies: Romeo and Juliet, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death;  and Julius Caesar—based on Sir Thomas North\\'s 1579 translation of Plutarch\\'s Parallel Lives—which introduced a new kind of drama.  According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro, in Julius Caesar \"the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even Shakespeare\\'s own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other\". \\n\\nIn the early 17th century, Shakespeare wrote the so-called \"problem plays\" Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida, and All\\'s Well That Ends Well and a number of his best known tragedies.  Many critics believe that Shakespeare\\'s greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art. The titular hero of one of Shakespeare\\'s most famous tragedies, Hamlet, has probably been discussed more than any other Shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which begins \"To be or not to be; that is the question\".  Unlike the introverted Hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, the heroes of the tragedies that followed, Othello and King Lear, are undone by hasty errors of judgement.  The plots of Shakespeare\\'s tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves.  In Othello, the villain Iago stokes Othello\\'s sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him.  In King Lear, the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear\\'s youngest daughter Cordelia. According to the critic Frank Kermode, \"the play-offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty\".  In Macbeth, the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare\\'s tragedies,  uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife, Lady Macbeth, to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne, until their own guilt destroys them in turn.  In this play, Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure. His last major tragedies, Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus, contain some of Shakespeare\\'s finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T. S. Eliot. \\n\\nIn his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: Cymbeline, The Winter\\'s Tale and The Tempest, as well as the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.  Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare\\'s part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day.  Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, probably with John Fletcher. \\n\\nPerformances\\n\\nIt is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays. The title page of the 1594 edition of Titus Andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes.  After the plagues of 1592–3, Shakespeare\\'s plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch, north of the Thames.  Londoners flocked there to see the first part of Henry IV, Leonard Digges recording, \"Let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest\\xa0... and you scarce shall have a room\".  When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark.  The Globe opened in autumn 1599, with Julius Caesar one of the first plays staged. Most of Shakespeare\\'s greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe, including Hamlet, Othello and King Lear. \\n\\nAfter the Lord Chamberlain\\'s Men were renamed the King\\'s Men in 1603, they entered a special relationship with the new King James. Although the performance records are patchy, the King\\'s Men performed seven of Shakespeare\\'s plays at court between 1 November 1604 and 31 October 1605, including two performances of The Merchant of Venice.  After 1608, they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer.  The indoor setting, combined with the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques, allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. In Cymbeline, for example, Jupiter descends \"in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees.\" \\n\\nThe actors in Shakespeare\\'s company included the famous Richard Burbage, William Kempe, Henry Condell and John Heminges. Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare\\'s plays, including Richard III, Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear.  The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in Romeo and Juliet and Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing, among other characters.  He was replaced around 1600 by Robert Armin, who played roles such as Touchstone in As You Like It and the fool in King Lear.  In 1613, Sir Henry Wotton recorded that Henry VIII \"was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony\". On 29 June, however, a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe and burned the theatre to the ground, an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision.\\n\\nTextual sources\\n\\nIn 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two of Shakespeare\\'s friends from the King\\'s Men, published the First Folio, a collected edition of Shakespeare\\'s plays. It contained 36 texts, including 18 printed for the first time.  Many of the plays had already appeared in quarto versions—flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves.  No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions, which the First Folio describes as \"stol\\'n and surreptitious copies\".  Nor did Shakespeare plan or expect his works to survive in any form at all; those works likely would have faded into oblivion but for his friends\\' spontaneous idea, after his death, to create and publish the First Folio. \\n\\nAlfred Pollard termed some of the pre-1623 versions as \"bad quartos\" because of their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory.  Where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the other. The differences may stem from copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from Shakespeare\\'s own papers.  In some cases, for example Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida and Othello, Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. In the case of King Lear, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto that the Oxford Shakespeare prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion. \\n\\nPoems\\n\\nIn 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare published two narrative poems on erotic themes, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in The Rape of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin.  Influenced by Ovid\\'s Metamorphoses,  the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust.  Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare\\'s lifetime. A third narrative poem, A Lover\\'s Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover\\'s Complaint. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects.  The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester\\'s 1601 Love\\'s Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare\\'s name but without his permission. \\n\\nSonnets\\n\\nPublished in 1609, the Sonnets were the last of Shakespeare\\'s non-dramatic works to be printed. Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership.  Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599, Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare\\'s \"sugred Sonnets among his private friends\".  Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare\\'s intended sequence.  He seems to have planned two contrasting series: one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion (the \"dark lady\"), and one about conflicted love for a fair young man (the \"fair youth\"). It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial \"I\" who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself, though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets \"Shakespeare unlocked his heart\". \\n\\nThe 1609 edition was dedicated to a \"Mr. W.H.\", credited as \"the only begetter\" of the poems. It is not known whether this was written by Shakespeare himself or by the publisher, Thomas Thorpe, whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page; nor is it known who Mr. W.H. was, despite numerous theories, or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication.  Critics praise the Sonnets as a profound meditation on the nature of love, sexual passion, procreation, death, and time. \\n\\nStyle\\n\\nShakespeare\\'s first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama.  The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted. \\n\\nSoon, however, Shakespeare began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard\\'s vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare\\'s mature plays.  No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles.  By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.\\n\\nShakespeare\\'s standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony.  Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet. Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet\\'s mind:.\\n\\nAfter Hamlet, Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as \"more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical\".  In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length.  In Macbeth, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: \"was the hope drunk/ Wherein you dressed yourself?\" (1.7.35–38); \"...\\xa0pity, like a naked new-born babe/ Striding the blast, or heaven\\'s cherubim, hors\\'d/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air\\xa0...\" (1.7.21–25). The listener is challenged to complete the sense. The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity. \\n\\nShakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre.  Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed.  He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama.  As Shakespeare\\'s mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In Shakespeare\\'s late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre. \\n\\nInfluence\\n\\nShakespeare\\'s work has made a lasting impression on later theatre and literature. In particular, he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation, plot, language, and genre.  Until Romeo and Juliet, for example, romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy.  Soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events; but Shakespeare used them to explore characters\\' minds.  His work heavily influenced later poetry. The Romantic poets attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama, though with little success. Critic George Steiner described all English verse dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson as \"feeble variations on Shakespearean themes.\" \\n\\nShakespeare influenced novelists such as Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melville\\'s soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick is a classic tragic hero, inspired by King Lear.  Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare\\'s works. These include two operas by Giuseppe Verdi, Otello and Falstaff, whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays.  Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites. The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli, a friend of William Blake, even translated Macbeth into German.  The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology, in particular that of Hamlet, for his theories of human nature. \\n\\nIn Shakespeare\\'s day, English grammar, spelling and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now, and his use of language helped shape modern English.  Samuel Johnson quoted him more often than any other author in his A Dictionary of the English Language, the first serious work of its type.  Expressions such as \"with bated breath\" (Merchant of Venice) and \"a foregone conclusion\" (Othello) have found their way into everyday English speech. \\n\\nCritical reputation\\n\\nShakespeare was not revered in his lifetime, but he received a large amount of praise.  In 1598, the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out from a group of English writers as \"the most excellent\" in both comedy and tragedy.  The authors of the Parnassus plays at St John\\'s College, Cambridge numbered him with Chaucer, Gower and Spenser.  In the First Folio, Ben Jonson called Shakespeare the \"Soul of the age, the applause, delight, the wonder of our stage\", though he had remarked elsewhere that \"Shakespeare wanted art\". \\n\\nBetween the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century, classical ideas were in vogue. As a result, critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson.  Thomas Rymer, for example, condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic. Nevertheless, poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly, saying of Jonson, \"I admire him, but I love Shakespeare\".  For several decades, Rymer\\'s view held sway; but during the 18th century, critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and acclaim what they termed his natural genius. A series of scholarly editions of his work, notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790, added to his growing reputation.  By 1800, he was firmly enshrined as the national poet.  In the 18th and 19th centuries, his reputation also spread abroad. Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire, Goethe, Stendhal and Victor Hugo. \\n\\nDuring the Romantic era, Shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge; and the critic August Wilhelm Schlegel translated his plays in the spirit of German Romanticism.  In the 19th century, critical admiration for Shakespeare\\'s genius often bordered on adulation.  \"That King Shakespeare,\" the essayist Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1840, \"does not he shine, in crowned sovereignty, over us all, as the noblest, gentlest, yet strongest of rallying signs; indestructible\".  The Victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale.  The playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw mocked the cult of Shakespeare worship as \"bardolatry\", claiming that the new naturalism of Ibsen\\'s plays had made Shakespeare obsolete. \\n\\nThe modernist revolution in the arts during the early 20th century, far from discarding Shakespeare, eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the avant-garde. The Expressionists in Germany and the Futurists in Moscow mounted productions of his plays. Marxist playwright and director Bertolt Brecht devised an epic theatre under the influence of Shakespeare. The poet and critic T.S. Eliot argued against Shaw that Shakespeare\\'s \"primitiveness\" in fact made him truly modern.  Eliot, along with G. Wilson Knight and the school of New Criticism, led a movement towards a closer reading of Shakespeare\\'s imagery. In the 1950s, a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for \"post-modern\" studies of Shakespeare.  By the 1980s, Shakespeare studies were open to movements such as structuralism, feminism, New Historicism, African-American studies, and queer studies.   In a comprehensive reading of Shakespeare\\'s works and comparing Shakespeare literary accomplishments to accomplishments among leading figures in philosophy and theology as well, Harold Bloom has commented that, \"Shakespeare was larger than Plato and than St. Augustine. He encloses us, because we see with his fundamental perceptions.\" \\n\\nWorks\\n\\nClassification of the plays\\n\\nShakespeare\\'s works include the 36 plays printed in the First Folio of 1623, listed according to their folio classification as comedies, histories and tragedies.  Two plays not included in the First Folio, The Two Noble Kinsmen and Pericles, Prince of Tyre, are now accepted as part of the canon, with today\\'s scholars agreeing that Shakespeare made major contributions to the writing of both.  No Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio.\\n\\nIn the late 19th century, Edward Dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances, and though many scholars prefer to call them tragicomedies, Dowden\\'s term is often used.  In 1896, Frederick S. Boas coined the term \"problem plays\" to describe four plays: All\\'s Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida and Hamlet.  \"Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies\", he wrote. \"We may therefore borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeare\\'s problem plays.\"  The term, much debated and sometimes applied to other plays, remains in use, though Hamlet is definitively classed as a tragedy. \\n\\nSpeculation about Shakespeare\\n\\nAuthorship\\n\\nAround 230 years after Shakespeare\\'s death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him.  Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.  Several \"group theories\" have also been proposed.  Only a small minority of academics believe there is reason to question the traditional attribution,  but interest in the subject, particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, continues into the 21st century. \\n\\nReligion\\n\\nSome scholars claim that members of Shakespeare\\'s family were Catholics, at a time when practicing Catholicism in England was against the law.  Shakespeare\\'s mother, Mary Arden, certainly came from a pious Catholic family. The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by his father, John Shakespeare, found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street. The document is now lost, however, and scholars differ as to its authenticity.  In 1591 the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church \"for fear of process for debt\", a common Catholic excuse.  In 1606, the name of William\\'s daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford. As several scholars have noted, whatever his private views, Shakespeare \"conformed to the official state religion\", as Park Honan put it.   Also, Shakespeare\\'s will uses a Protestant formula, and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England, where he was married, his children were baptized, and where he is buried. Other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about Shakespeare\\'s religious beliefs. Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare\\'s Catholicism, Protestantism, or lack of belief in his plays, but the truth may be impossible to prove. \\n\\nSexuality\\n\\nFew details of Shakespeare\\'s sexuality are known. At 18, he married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway, who was pregnant. Susanna, the first of their three children, was born six months later on 26 May 1583. Over the centuries, some readers have posited that Shakespeare\\'s sonnets are autobiographical,  and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love.  The 26 so-called \"Dark Lady\" sonnets, addressed to a married woman, are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons. \\n\\nPortraiture\\n\\nNo written contemporary description of Shakespeare\\'s physical appearance survives, and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait, so the Droeshout engraving, which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness,  and his Stratford monument provide perhaps the best evidence of his appearance. From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led to the production of several fake portraits, as well as mis-attributions, repaintings and relabelling of portraits of other people.',\n",
              "   'Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families. It was among Shakespeare\\'s most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed plays. Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers.\\n\\nRomeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity.  The plot is based on an Italian tale translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562, and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567. Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both, but expanded the plot by developing a number of supporting characters, particularly Mercutio and Paris. Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597. The text of the first quarto version was of poor quality, however, and later editions corrected the text to conform more closely with Shakespeare\\'s original.\\n\\nShakespeare\\'s use of his poetic dramatic structure (especially effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension, his expansion of minor characters, and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story) has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill.  The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops. Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the sonnet over the course of the play.\\n\\nRomeo and Juliet has been adapted numerous times for stage, film, musical and opera venues. During the English Restoration, it was revived and heavily revised by William Davenant.  David Garrick\\'s 18th-century version also modified several scenes, removing material then considered indecent, and Georg Benda\\'s Romeo und Julie omitted much of the action, and added a happy ending. Performances in the 19th century, including Charlotte Cushman\\'s, restored the original text, and focused on greater realism. John Gielgud\\'s 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare\\'s text, and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama. In the 20th and into the 21st century, the play has been adapted in versions as diverse as George Cukor\\'s 1935 film Romeo and Juliet, Franco Zeffirelli\\'s 1968 version Romeo and Juliet, and Baz Luhrmann\\'s 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet.\\n\\nCharacters\\n\\n;Ruling house of Verona\\n*Prince Escalus is the ruling Prince of Verona.\\n*Count Paris is a kinsman of Escalus who wishes to marry Juliet.\\n*Mercutio is another kinsman of Escalus, and a friend of Romeo.\\n\\n;House of Capulet\\n*Capulet is the patriarch of the house of Capulet.\\n*Lady Capulet is the matriarch of the house of Capulet.\\n*Juliet is the 13-year-old daughter of Capulet, and the play\\'s female protagonist.\\n*Tybalt is a cousin of Juliet, and the nephew of Lady Capulet.\\n*The Nurse is Juliet\\'s personal attendant and confidante.\\n*Rosaline is Lord Capulet\\'s niece, and Romeo\\'s love in the beginning of the story.\\n*Peter, Sampson and Gregory are servants of the Capulet household.\\n\\n;House of Montague\\n*Montague is the patriarch of the house of Montague.\\n*Lady Montague is the matriarch of the house of Montague.\\n*Romeo is the son of Montague, and the play\\'s male protagonist.\\n*Benvolio is Romeo\\'s cousin and best friend.\\n*Abram and Balthasar are servants of the Montague household.\\n\\n;Others\\n*Friar Laurence is a Franciscan friar, and is Romeo\\'s confidant.\\n*Friar John is sent to deliver Friar Laurence\\'s letter to Romeo.\\n*An Apothecary who reluctantly sells Romeo poison.\\n*A Chorus reads a prologue to each of the first two acts.\\n\\nSynopsis\\n\\nThe play, set in Verona, Italy, begins with a street brawl between Montague and Capulet servants who, like their masters, are sworn enemies. Prince Escalus of Verona intervenes and declares that further breach of the peace will be punishable by death. Later, Count Paris talks to Capulet about marrying his daughter Juliet, but Capulet asks Paris to wait another two years and invites him to attend a planned Capulet ball. Lady Capulet and Juliet\\'s nurse try to persuade Juliet to accept Paris\\'s courtship.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Benvolio talks with his cousin Romeo, Montague\\'s son, about Romeo\\'s recent depression. Benvolio discovers that it stems from unrequited infatuation for a girl named Rosaline, one of Capulet\\'s nieces. Persuaded by Benvolio and Mercutio, Romeo attends the ball at the Capulet house in hopes of meeting Rosaline. However, Romeo instead meets and falls in love with Juliet. Juliet\\'s cousin, Tybalt, is enraged at Romeo for sneaking into the ball, but is only stopped from killing Romeo by Juliet\\'s father, who doesn\\'t wish to shed blood in his house. After the ball, in what is now called the \"balcony scene\", Romeo sneaks into the Capulet orchard and overhears Juliet at her window vowing her love to him in spite of her family\\'s hatred of the Montagues. Romeo makes himself known to her and they agree to be married.  With the help of Friar Laurence, who hopes to reconcile the two families through their children\\'s union, they are secretly married the next day.\\n\\nTybalt, meanwhile, still incensed that Romeo had sneaked into the Capulet ball, challenges him to a duel. Romeo, now considering Tybalt his kinsman, refuses to fight. Mercutio is offended by Tybalt\\'s insolence, as well as Romeo\\'s \"vile submission\",  and accepts the duel on Romeo\\'s behalf. Mercutio is fatally wounded when Romeo attempts to break up the fight. Grief-stricken and wracked with guilt, Romeo confronts and slays Tybalt.\\n\\nMontague argues that Romeo has justly executed Tybalt for the murder of Mercutio.  The Prince, now having lost a kinsman in the warring families\\' feud, exiles Romeo from Verona, under penalty of death if he ever returns.  Romeo secretly spends the night in Juliet\\'s chamber, where they consummate their marriage. Capulet, misinterpreting Juliet\\'s grief, agrees to marry her to Count Paris and threatens to disown her when she refuses to become Paris\\'s \"joyful bride\".  When she then pleads for the marriage to be delayed, her mother rejects her.\\n\\nJuliet visits Friar Laurence for help, and he offers her a potion that will put her into a deathlike coma for \"two and forty hours\".  The Friar promises to send a messenger to inform Romeo of the plan, so that he can rejoin her when she awakens.  On the night before the wedding, she takes the drug and, when discovered apparently dead, she is laid in the family crypt.\\n\\nThe messenger, however, does not reach Romeo and, instead, Romeo learns of Juliet\\'s apparent death from his servant Balthasar. Heartbroken, Romeo buys poison from an apothecary and goes to the Capulet crypt. He encounters Paris who has come to mourn Juliet privately. Believing Romeo to be a vandal, Paris confronts him and, in the ensuing battle, Romeo kills Paris.  Still believing Juliet to be dead, he drinks the poison. Juliet then awakens and, finding Romeo dead, stabs herself with his dagger. The feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb to find all three dead. Friar Laurence recounts the story of the two \"star-cross\\'d lovers\". The families are reconciled by their children\\'s deaths and agree to end their violent feud. The play ends with the Prince\\'s elegy for the lovers: \"For never was a story of more woe/Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.\" \\n\\nSources\\n\\nRomeo and Juliet borrows from a tradition of tragic love stories dating back to antiquity. One of these is Pyramus and Thisbe, from Ovid\\'s Metamorphoses, which contains parallels to Shakespeare\\'s story: the lovers\\' parents despise each other, and Pyramus falsely believes his lover Thisbe is dead.  The Ephesiaca of Xenophon of Ephesus, written in the 3rd century, also contains several similarities to the play, including the separation of the lovers, and a potion that induces a deathlike sleep. \\n\\nOne of the earliest references to the names Montague and Capulet is from Dante\\'s Divine Comedy, who mentions the Montecchi (Montagues) and the Cappelletti (Capulets) in canto six of Purgatorio: \\n\\nHowever, the reference is part of a polemic against the moral decay of Florence, Lombardy and the Italian Peninsula as a whole; Dante, through his characters, chastises German King Albert I for neglecting his responsibilities towards Italy (\"you who are negligent\"), and successive popes for their encroachment from purely spiritual affairs, thus leading to a climate of incessant bickering and warfare between rival political parties in Lombardy. History records the name of the family Montague as being lent to such a political party in Verona, but that of the Capulets as from a Cremonese family, both of whom play out their conflict in Lombardy as a whole rather than within the confines of Verona.  Allied to rival political factions, the parties are grieving (\"One lot already grieving\") because their endless warfare has led to the destruction of both parties, rather than a grief from the loss of their ill-fated offspring as the play sets forth, which appears to be a solely poetic creation within this context.\\n\\nThe earliest known version of the Romeo and Juliet tale akin to Shakespeare\\'s play is the story of Mariotto and Gianozza by Masuccio Salernitano, in the 33rd novel of his Il Novellino published in 1476. Salernitano sets the story in Siena and insists its events took place in his own lifetime. His version of the story includes the secret marriage, the colluding friar, the fray where a prominent citizen is killed, Mariotto\\'s exile, Gianozza\\'s forced marriage, the potion plot, and the crucial message that goes astray. In this version, Mariotto is caught and beheaded and Gianozza dies of grief. \\n\\nModern form\\n\\nLuigi da Porto (1485–1529) adapted the story as Giulietta e Romeo  and included it in his Historia novellamente ritrovata di due Nobili Amanti, written in 1524 and published posthumously in 1531 in Venice. Moore (1937: 38–44).  Da Porto drew on Pyramus and Thisbe, Boccacio\\'s Decameron, and Salernitano\\'s Mariotto e Ganozza, but it is likely that his story is also autobiographical: present as a soldier at a ball on 26 February 1511 at a residence of the Savorgnan clan in Udine, following a peace ceremony with the opposite Strumieri, Da Porta fell in love with Lucina, the daughter of the house, but relationships of their mentors prevented advances. The next morning, the Savorgnans led an attack on the city, and many members of the Strumieri were murdered.  When years later, half-paralyzed from a battle-wound, he wrote Giulietta e Romeo in Montorso Vicentino (from where he could see the \"castles\" of Verona), he dedicated the novella to bellisima e leggiadra madonna Lucina Savorgnan.  Da Porto presented his tale as historically true and claimed it took place a century earlier than Salernitano had it, in the days Verona was ruled by Bartolomeo II della Scala (anglicized as Prince Escalus).\\n\\nDa Porto gave Romeo and Juliet most of its modern form, including the names of the lovers, the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti, and the location in Verona.  He named the friar Laurence (frate Lorenzo) and introduced the characters Mercutio (Marcuccio Guertio), Tybalt (Tebaldo Cappelleti), Count Paris (conti (Paride) di Lodrone), the faithful servant, and Giulietta\\'s nurse. Da Porto originated the remaining basic elements of the story: the feuding families, Romeo -left by his mistress- meeting Giulietta at a dance at her house, the love scenes (including the balcony scene), the periods of despair, Romeo killing Giulietta\\'s cousin (Tebaldo), and the families\\' reconciliation after the lovers\\' suicides. In da Porto\\'s version Romeo takes poison and Giulietta stabs herself with his dagger. \\n\\nIn 1554, Matteo Bandello published the second volume of his Novelle, which included his version of Giuletta e Romeo, probably written between 1531 and 1545.  Bandello lengthened and weighed down the plot, while leaving the storyline basically unchanged (though he did introduce Benvolio). Bandello\\'s story was translated into French by Pierre Boaistuau in 1559 in the first volume of his Histories Tragiques. Boaistuau adds much moralising and sentiment, and the characters indulge in rhetorical outbursts. \\n\\nIn his 1562 narrative poem The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet, Arthur Brooke translated Boaistuau faithfully, but adjusted it to reflect parts of Chaucer\\'s Troilus and Criseyde.  There was a trend among writers and playwrights to publish works based on Italian novelles—Italian tales were very popular among theatre-goers—and Shakespeare may well have been familiar with William Painter\\'s 1567 collection of Italian tales titled Palace of Pleasure.  This collection included a version in prose of the Romeo and Juliet story named \"The goodly History of the true and constant love of Romeo and Juliett\". Shakespeare took advantage of this popularity: The Merchant of Venice, Much Ado About Nothing, All\\'s Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure, and Romeo and Juliet are all from Italian novelle. Romeo and Juliet is a dramatisation of Brooke\\'s translation, and Shakespeare follows the poem closely, but adds extra detail to both major and minor characters (in particular the Nurse and Mercutio).   \\n\\nChristopher Marlowe\\'s Hero and Leander and Dido, Queen of Carthage, both similar stories written in Shakespeare\\'s day, are thought to be less of a direct influence, although they may have helped create an atmosphere in which tragic love stories could thrive.\\n\\nDate and text\\n\\nIt is unknown when exactly Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet. Juliet\\'s nurse refers to an earthquake she says occurred 11 years ago.  This may refer to the Dover Straits earthquake of 1580, which would date that particular line to 1591. Other earthquakes—both in England and in Verona—have been proposed in support of the different dates.  But the play\\'s stylistic similarities with A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream and other plays conventionally dated around 1594–95, place its composition sometime between 1591 and 1595.  One conjecture is that Shakespeare may have begun a draft in 1591, which he completed in 1595. \\n\\nShakespeare\\'s Romeo and Juliet was published in two quarto editions prior to the publication of the First Folio of 1623. These are referred to as Q1 and Q2. The first printed edition, Q1, appeared in early 1597, printed by John Danter. Because its text contains numerous differences from the later editions, it is labelled a \\'bad quarto\\'; the 20th-century editor T. J. B. Spencer described it as \"a detestable text, probably a reconstruction of the play from the imperfect memories of one or two of the actors\", suggesting that it had been pirated for publication.  An alternative explanation for Q1\\'s shortcomings is that the play (like many others of the time) may have been heavily edited before performance by the playing company.  In any event, its appearance in early 1597 makes 1596 the latest possible date for the play\\'s composition.\\n\\nThe superior Q2 called the play The Most Excellent and Lamentable Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet. It was printed in 1599 by Thomas Creede and published by Cuthbert Burby. Q2 is about 800 lines longer than Q1. Its title page describes it as \"Newly corrected, augmented and amended\". Scholars believe that Q2 was based on Shakespeare\\'s pre-performance draft (called his foul papers), since there are textual oddities such as variable tags for characters and \"false starts\" for speeches that were presumably struck through by the author but erroneously preserved by the typesetter. It is a much more complete and reliable text, and was reprinted in 1609 (Q3), 1622 (Q4) and 1637 (Q5). In effect, all later Quartos and Folios of Romeo and Juliet are based on Q2, as are all modern editions since editors believe that any deviations from Q2 in the later editions (whether good or bad) are likely to arise from editors or compositors, not from Shakespeare.\\n\\nThe First Folio text of 1623 was based primarily on Q3, with clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical promptbook or Q1.  Other Folio editions of the play were printed in 1632 (F2), 1664 (F3), and 1685 (F4).  Modern versions—that take into account several of the Folios and Quartos—first appeared with Nicholas Rowe\\'s 1709 edition, followed by Alexander Pope\\'s 1723 version. Pope began a tradition of editing the play to add information such as stage directions missing in Q2 by locating them in Q1. This tradition continued late into the Romantic period. Fully annotated editions first appeared in the Victorian period and continue to be produced today, printing the text of the play with footnotes describing the sources and culture behind the play. \\n\\nThemes and motifs\\n\\nScholars have found it extremely difficult to assign one specific, overarching theme to the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters that human beings are neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead are more or less alike,  awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found it is clear that the play is full of several small, thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways. Several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below. \\n\\nLove\\n\\nRomeo and Juliet is sometimes considered to have no unifying theme, save that of young love. Romeo and Juliet have become emblematic of young lovers and doomed love. Since it is such an obvious subject of the play, several scholars have explored the language and historical context behind the romance of the play. \\n\\nOn their first meeting, Romeo and Juliet use a form of communication recommended by many etiquette authors in Shakespeare\\'s day: metaphor. By using metaphors of saints and sins, Romeo was able to test Juliet\\'s feelings for him in a non-threatening way. This method was recommended by Baldassare Castiglione (whose works had been translated into English by this time). He pointed out that if a man used a metaphor as an invitation, the woman could pretend she did not understand him, and he could retreat without losing honour. Juliet, however, participates in the metaphor and expands on it. The religious metaphors of \"shrine\", \"pilgrim\" and \"saint\" were fashionable in the poetry of the time and more likely to be understood as romantic rather than blasphemous, as the concept of sainthood was associated with the Catholicism of an earlier age.  Later in the play, Shakespeare removes the more daring allusions to Christ\\'s resurrection in the tomb he found in his source work: Brooke\\'s Romeus and Juliet. \\n\\nIn the later balcony scene, Shakespeare has Romeo overhear Juliet\\'s soliloquy, but in Brooke\\'s version of the story her declaration is done alone. By bringing Romeo into the scene to eavesdrop, Shakespeare breaks from the normal sequence of courtship. Usually a woman was required to be modest and shy to make sure that her suitor was sincere, but breaking this rule serves to speed along the plot. The lovers are able to skip courting, and move on to plain talk about their relationship— agreeing to be married after knowing each other for only one night. In the final suicide scene, there is a contradiction in the message—in the Catholic religion, suicides were often thought to be condemned to hell, whereas people who die to be with their loves under the \"Religion of Love\" are joined with their loves in paradise. Romeo and Juliet\\'s love seems to be expressing the \"Religion of Love\" view rather than the Catholic view. Another point is that although their love is passionate, it is only consummated in marriage, which keeps them from losing the audience\\'s sympathy. \\n\\nThe play arguably equates love and sex with death. Throughout the story, both Romeo and Juliet, along with the other characters, fantasise about it as a dark being, often equating it with a lover. Capulet, for example, when he first discovers Juliet\\'s (faked) death, describes it as having deflowered his daughter.  Juliet later erotically compares Romeo and death. Right before her suicide she grabs Romeo\\'s dagger, saying \"O happy dagger! This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die.\"  \\n\\nFate and chance\\n\\nScholars are divided on the role of fate in the play. No consensus exists on whether the characters are truly fated to die together or whether the events take place by a series of unlucky chances. Arguments in favour of fate often refer to the description of the lovers as \"star-cross\\'d\".  This phrase seems to hint that the stars have predetermined the lovers\\' future.  John W. Draper points out the parallels between the Elizabethan belief in the four humours and the main characters of the play (for example, Tybalt as a choleric). Interpreting the text in the light of humours reduces the amount of plot attributed to chance by modern audiences.  Still, other scholars see the play as a series of unlucky chances—many to such a degree that they do not see it as a tragedy at all, but an emotional melodrama. Ruth Nevo believes the high degree to which chance is stressed in the narrative makes Romeo and Juliet a \"lesser tragedy\" of happenstance, not of character. For example, Romeo\\'s challenging Tybalt is not impulsive; it is, after Mercutio\\'s death, the expected action to take. In this scene, Nevo reads Romeo as being aware of the dangers of flouting social norms, identity and commitments. He makes the choice to kill, not because of a tragic flaw, but because of circumstance. \\n\\nDuality (light and dark)\\n\\nScholars have long noted Shakespeare\\'s widespread use of light and dark imagery throughout the play. Caroline Spurgeon considers the theme of light as \"symbolic of the natural beauty of young love\" and later critics have expanded on this interpretation.  For example, both Romeo and Juliet see the other as light in a surrounding darkness. Romeo describes Juliet as being like the sun,  brighter than a torch,  a jewel sparkling in the night,  and a bright angel among dark clouds.  Even when she lies apparently dead in the tomb, he says her \"beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light.\"  Juliet describes Romeo as \"day in night\" and \"Whiter than snow upon a raven\\'s back.\"   This contrast of light and dark can be expanded as symbols—contrasting love and hate, youth and age in a metaphoric way. Sometimes these intertwining metaphors create dramatic irony. For example, Romeo and Juliet\\'s love is a light in the midst of the darkness of the hate around them, but all of their activity together is done in night and darkness, while all of the feuding is done in broad daylight. This paradox of imagery adds atmosphere to the moral dilemma facing the two lovers: loyalty to family or loyalty to love. At the end of the story, when the morning is gloomy and the sun hiding its face for sorrow, light and dark have returned to their proper places, the outward darkness reflecting the true, inner darkness of the family feud out of sorrow for the lovers. All characters now recognise their folly in light of recent events, and things return to the natural order, thanks to the love and death of Romeo and Juliet. The \"light\" theme in the play is also heavily connected to the theme of time, since light was a convenient way for Shakespeare to express the passage of time through descriptions of the sun, moon, and stars. \\n\\nTime\\n\\nTime plays an important role in the language and plot of the play. Both Romeo and Juliet struggle to maintain an imaginary world void of time in the face of the harsh realities that surround them. For instance, when Romeo swears his love to Juliet by the moon, she protests \"O swear not by the moon, th\\'inconstant moon, / That monthly changes in her circled orb, / Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.\"  From the very beginning, the lovers are designated as \"star-cross\\'d\"  referring to an astrologic belief associated with time. Stars were thought to control the fates of humanity, and as time passed, stars would move along their course in the sky, also charting the course of human lives below. Romeo speaks of a foreboding he feels in the stars\\' movements early in the play, and when he learns of Juliet\\'s death, he defies the stars\\' course for him. \\n\\nAnother central theme is haste: Shakespeare\\'s Romeo and Juliet spans a period of four to six days, in contrast to Brooke\\'s poem\\'s spanning nine months. Scholars such as G. Thomas Tanselle believe that time was \"especially important to Shakespeare\" in this play, as he used references to \"short-time\" for the young lovers as opposed to references to \"long-time\" for the \"older generation\" to highlight \"a headlong rush towards doom\". Romeo and Juliet fight time to make their love last forever. In the end, the only way they seem to defeat time is through a death that makes them immortal through art. \\n\\nTime is also connected to the theme of light and dark. In Shakespeare\\'s day, plays were most often performed at noon or in the afternoon in broad daylight.  This forced the playwright to use words to create the illusion of day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion. He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to the illusion of its passage. \\n\\nCriticism and interpretation\\n\\nCritical history\\n\\nThe earliest known critic of the play was diarist Samuel Pepys, who wrote in 1662: \"it is a play of itself the worst that I ever heard in my life.\"  Poet John Dryden wrote 10 years later in praise of the play and its comic character Mercutio: \"Shakespear show\\'d the best of his skill in his Mercutio, and he said himself, that he was forc\\'d to kill him in the third Act, to prevent being killed by him.\" Criticism of the play in the 18th century was less sparse, but no less divided. Publisher Nicholas Rowe was the first critic to ponder the theme of the play, which he saw as the just punishment of the two feuding families. In mid-century, writer Charles Gildon and philosopher Lord Kames argued that the play was a failure in that it did not follow the classical rules of drama: the tragedy must occur because of some character flaw, not an accident of fate. Writer and critic Samuel Johnson, however, considered it one of Shakespeare\\'s \"most pleasing\" plays. \\n\\nIn the later part of the 18th and through the 19th century, criticism centred on debates over the moral message of the play. Actor and playwright David Garrick\\'s 1748 adaptation excluded Rosaline: Romeo abandoning her for Juliet was seen as fickle and reckless. Critics such as Charles Dibdin argued that Rosaline had been purposely included in the play to show how reckless the hero was, and that this was the reason for his tragic end. Others argued that Friar Laurence might be Shakespeare\\'s spokesman in his warnings against undue haste. With the advent of the 20th century, these moral arguments were disputed by critics such as Richard Green Moulton: he argued that accident, and not some character flaw, led to the lovers\\' deaths. \\n\\nDramatic structure\\n\\nIn Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare employs several dramatic techniques that have garnered praise from critics; most notably the abrupt shifts from comedy to tragedy (an example is the punning exchange between Benvolio and Mercutio just before Tybalt arrives). Before Mercutio\\'s death in Act three, the play is largely a comedy.  After his accidental demise, the play suddenly becomes serious and takes on a tragic tone. When Romeo is banished, rather than executed, and Friar Laurence offers Juliet a plan to reunite her with Romeo, the audience can still hope that all will end well. They are in a \"breathless state of suspense\" by the opening of the last scene in the tomb: If Romeo is delayed long enough for the Friar to arrive, he and Juliet may yet be saved.  These shifts from hope to despair, reprieve, and new hope, serve to emphasise the tragedy when the final hope fails and both the lovers die at the end. \\n\\nShakespeare also uses sub-plots to offer a clearer view of the actions of the main characters. For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances. Romeo\\'s infatuation with her stands in obvious contrast to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet\\'s love and marriage. Paris\\' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet\\'s feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the sub-plot of the Montague–Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play\\'s tragic end.\\n\\nLanguage\\n\\nShakespeare uses a variety of poetic forms throughout the play. He begins with a 14-line prologue in the form of a Shakespearean sonnet, spoken by a Chorus. Most of Romeo and Juliet is, however, written in blank verse, and much of it in strict iambic pentameter, with less rhythmic variation than in most of Shakespeare\\'s later plays.  In choosing forms, Shakespeare matches the poetry to the character who uses it. Friar Laurence, for example, uses sermon and sententiae forms, and the Nurse uses a unique blank verse form that closely matches colloquial speech. Each of these forms is also moulded and matched to the emotion of the scene the character occupies. For example, when Romeo talks about Rosaline earlier in the play, he attempts to use the Petrarchan sonnet form. Petrarchan sonnets were often used by men to exaggerate the beauty of women who were impossible for them to attain, as in Romeo\\'s situation with Rosaline. This sonnet form is used by Lady Capulet to describe Count Paris to Juliet as a handsome man.  When Romeo and Juliet meet, the poetic form changes from the Petrarchan (which was becoming archaic in Shakespeare\\'s day) to a then more contemporary sonnet form, using \"pilgrims\" and \"saints\" as metaphors.  Finally, when the two meet on the balcony, Romeo attempts to use the sonnet form to pledge his love, but Juliet breaks it by saying \"Dost thou love me?\"  By doing this, she searches for true expression, rather than a poetic exaggeration of their love.  Juliet uses monosyllabic words with Romeo, but uses formal language with Paris.  Other forms in the play include an epithalamium by Juliet, a rhapsody in Mercutio\\'s Queen Mab speech, and an elegy by Paris.  Shakespeare saves his prose style most often for the common people in the play, though at times he uses it for other characters, such as Mercutio.  Humour, also, is important: scholar Molly Mahood identifies at least 175 puns and wordplays in the text.  Many of these jokes are sexual in nature, especially those involving Mercutio and the Nurse. \\n\\nPsychoanalytic criticism\\n\\nEarly psychoanalytic critics saw the problem of Romeo and Juliet in terms of Romeo\\'s impulsiveness, deriving from \"ill-controlled, partially disguised aggression\", which leads both to Mercutio\\'s death and to the double suicide.  Romeo and Juliet is not considered to be exceedingly psychologically complex, and sympathetic psychoanalytic readings of the play make the tragic male experience equivalent with sicknesses.  Norman Holland, writing in 1966, considers Romeo\\'s dream  as a realistic \"wish fulfilling fantasy both in terms of Romeo\\'s adult world and his hypothetical childhood at stages oral, phallic and oedipal\" – while acknowledging that a dramatic character is not a human being with mental processes separate from those of the author.  Critics such as Julia Kristeva focus on the hatred between the families, arguing that this hatred is the cause of Romeo and Juliet\\'s passion for each other. That hatred manifests itself directly in the lovers\\' language: Juliet, for example, speaks of \"my only love sprung from my only hate\"  and often expresses her passion through an anticipation of Romeo\\'s death.  This leads on to speculation as to the playwright\\'s psychology, in particular to a consideration of Shakespeare\\'s grief for the death of his son, Hamnet. \\n\\nFeminist criticism\\n\\nFeminist literary critics argue that the blame for the family feud lies in Verona\\'s patriarchal society. For Coppélia Kahn, for example, the strict, masculine code of violence imposed on Romeo is the main force driving the tragedy to its end. When Tybalt kills Mercutio, Romeo shifts into this violent mode, regretting that Juliet has made him so \"effeminate\".  In this view, the younger males \"become men\" by engaging in violence on behalf of their fathers, or in the case of the servants, their masters. The feud is also linked to male virility, as the numerous jokes about maidenheads aptly demonstrate.  Juliet also submits to a female code of docility by allowing others, such as the Friar, to solve her problems for her. Other critics, such as Dympna Callaghan, look at the play\\'s feminism from a historicist angle, stressing that when the play was written the feudal order was being challenged by increasingly centralised government and the advent of capitalism. At the same time, emerging Puritan ideas about marriage were less concerned with the \"evils of female sexuality\" than those of earlier eras, and more sympathetic towards love-matches: when Juliet dodges her father\\'s attempt to force her to marry a man she has no feeling for, she is challenging the patriarchal order in a way that would not have been possible at an earlier time. \\n\\nQueer theory\\n\\nA number of critics have found the character of Mercutio to have unacknowledged homoerotic desire for Romeo.  Jonathan Goldberg examined the sexuality of Mercutio and Romeo utilising \"queer theory\" in Queering the Renaissance, comparing their friendship with sexual love. Mercutio, in friendly conversation, mentions Romeo\\'s phallus, suggesting traces of homoeroticism.  An example is his joking wish \"To raise a spirit in his mistress\\' circle ... letting it there stand / Till she had laid it and conjured it down.\"   Romeo\\'s homoeroticism can also be found in his attitude to Rosaline, a woman who is distant and unavailable and brings no hope of offspring. As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate. Shakespeare\\'s procreation sonnets describe another young man who, like Romeo, is having trouble creating offspring and who may be seen as being a homosexual. Goldberg believes that Shakespeare may have used Rosaline as a way to express homosexual problems of procreation in an acceptable way. In this view, when Juliet says \"...that which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet\",  she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman. \\n\\nThe Balcony Scene\\n\\nThe balcony scene was introduced by Da Porto in 1524. He had Romeo walk frequently by her house, \"sometimes climbing to her chamber window\" and wrote \"It happened one night, as love ordained, when the moon shone unusually bright, that whilst Romeo was climbing the balcony, the young lady ... opened the window, and looking out saw him\".  After this they have a conversation in which they declare eternal love to each other. A few decades later, Bandello greatly expanded this scene, diverging from the familiar one: Julia has her nurse deliver a letter asking Romeo to come to her window with a rope ladder, and he climbs the balcony with the help of his servant, Julia and the nurse (the servants discreetly withdraw after this).\\n\\nNevertheless, in October 2014, Lois Leveen speculated in The Atlantic that the original Shakespeare play did not contain a balcony.  The word, balcone, did not exist in the English language until two years after Shakespeare\\'s death.  The balcony was certainly used in Thomas Otway\\'s 1679 play, The History and Fall of Caius Marius, which had borrowed much of its story from Romeo and Juliet and placed the two lovers in a balcony reciting a speech similar to that between Romeo and Juliet. Leveen suggested that during the 18th century, David Garrick chose to use a balcony in his adaptation and revival of Romeo and Juliet and modern adaptations have continued this tradition.\\n\\nLegacy\\n\\nShakespeare\\'s day\\n\\nRomeo and Juliet ranks with Hamlet as one of Shakespeare\\'s most performed plays. Its many adaptations have made it one of his most enduring and famous stories.  Even in Shakespeare\\'s lifetime it was extremely popular. Scholar Gary Taylor measures it as the sixth most popular of Shakespeare\\'s plays, in the period after the death of Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd but before the ascendancy of Ben Jonson during which Shakespeare was London\\'s dominant playwright.  The date of the first performance is unknown. The First Quarto, printed in 1597, says that \"it hath been often (and with great applause) plaid publiquely\", setting the first performance before that date. The Lord Chamberlain\\'s Men were certainly the first to perform it. Besides their strong connections with Shakespeare, the Second Quarto actually names one of its actors, Will Kemp, instead of Peter in a line in Act five. Richard Burbage was probably the first Romeo, being the company\\'s actor, and Master Robert Goffe (a boy) the first Juliet. The premiere is likely to have been at \"The Theatre\", with other early productions at \"The Curtain\".  Romeo and Juliet is one of the first Shakespearean plays to have been performed outside England: a shortened and simplified version was performed in Nördlingen in 1604. \\n\\nRestoration and 18th-century theatre\\n\\nAll theatres were closed down by the puritan government on September 6, 1642. Upon the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, two patent companies (the King\\'s Company and the Duke\\'s Company) were established, and the existing theatrical repertoire divided between them. \\n\\nSir William Davenant of the Duke\\'s Company staged a 1662 adaptation in which Henry Harris played Romeo, Thomas Betterton Mercutio, and Betterton\\'s wife Mary Saunderson Juliet: she was probably the first woman to play the role professionally.  Another version closely followed Davenant\\'s adaptation and was also regularly performed by the Duke\\'s Company. This was a tragicomedy by James Howard, in which the two lovers survive. \\n\\nThomas Otway\\'s The History and Fall of Caius Marius, one of the more extreme of the Restoration adaptations of Shakespeare, debuted in 1680. The scene is shifted from Renaissance Verona to ancient Rome; Romeo is Marius, Juliet is Lavinia, the feud is between patricians and plebeians; Juliet/Lavinia wakes from her potion before Romeo/Marius dies. Otway\\'s version was a hit, and was acted for the next seventy years. His innovation in the closing scene was even more enduring, and was used in adaptations throughout the next 200 years: Theophilus Cibber\\'s adaptation of 1744, and David Garrick\\'s of 1748 both used variations on it.  These versions also eliminated elements deemed inappropriate at the time. For example, Garrick\\'s version transferred all language describing Rosaline to Juliet, to heighten the idea of faithfulness and downplay the love-at-first-sight theme.  In 1750 a \"Battle of the Romeos\" began, with Spranger Barry and Susannah Maria Arne (Mrs. Theophilus Cibber) at Covent Garden versus David Garrick and George Anne Bellamy at Drury Lane. \\n\\nThe earliest known production in North America was an amateur one: on 23 March 1730, a physician named Joachimus Bertrand placed an advertisement in the Gazette newspaper in New York, promoting a production in which he would play the apothecary.  The first professional performances of the play in North America were those of the Hallam Company. \\n\\n19th-century theatre\\n\\nGarrick\\'s altered version of the play was very popular, and ran for nearly a century. Not until 1845 did Shakespeare\\'s original return to the stage in the United States with the sisters Susan and Charlotte Cushman as Juliet and Romeo, respectively,  and then in 1847 in Britain with Samuel Phelps at Sadler\\'s Wells Theatre.  Cushman adhered to Shakespeare\\'s version, beginning a string of eighty-four performances. Her portrayal of Romeo was considered genius by many. The Times wrote: \"For a long time Romeo has been a convention. Miss Cushman\\'s Romeo is a creative, a living, breathing, animated, ardent human being.\"  Queen Victoria wrote in her journal that \"no-one would ever have imagined she was a woman\".  Cushman\\'s success broke the Garrick tradition and paved the way for later performances to return to the original storyline.\\n\\nProfessional performances of Shakespeare in the mid-19th century had two particular features: firstly, they were generally star vehicles, with supporting roles cut or marginalised to give greater prominence to the central characters. Secondly, they were \"pictorial\", placing the action on spectacular and elaborate sets (requiring lengthy pauses for scene changes) and with the frequent use of tableaux.  Henry Irving\\'s 1882 production at the Lyceum Theatre (with himself as Romeo and Ellen Terry as Juliet) is considered an archetype of the pictorial style.  In 1895, Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson took over from Irving, and laid the groundwork for a more natural portrayal of Shakespeare that remains popular today. Forbes-Robertson avoided the showiness of Irving and instead portrayed a down-to-earth Romeo, expressing the poetic dialogue as realistic prose and avoiding melodramatic flourish. \\n\\nAmerican actors began to rival their British counterparts. Edwin Booth (brother to John Wilkes Booth) and Mary McVicker (soon to be Edwin\\'s wife) opened as Romeo and Juliet at the sumptuous Booth\\'s Theatre (with its European-style stage machinery, and an air conditioning system unique in New York) on 3 February 1869. Some reports said it was one of the most elaborate productions of Romeo and Juliet ever seen in America; it was certainly the most popular, running for over six weeks and earning over $60,000  (equal to about $ today). The programme noted that: \"The tragedy will be produced in strict accordance with historical propriety, in every respect, following closely the text of Shakespeare.\" \\n\\nThe first professional performance of the play in Japan may have been George Crichton Miln\\'s company\\'s production, which toured to Yokohama in 1890.  Throughout the 19th century, Romeo and Juliet had been Shakespeare\\'s most popular play, measured by the number of professional performances. In the 20th century it would become the second most popular, behind Hamlet. \\n\\n20th-century theatre\\n\\nIn 1933, the play was revived by actress Katharine Cornell and her director husband Guthrie McClintic and was taken on a seven-month nationwide tour throughout the United States. It starred Orson Welles, Brian Aherne and Basil Rathbone. The production was a modest success, and so upon the return to New York, Cornell and McClintic revised it and for the first time, the play was presented with almost all the scenes intact, including the Prologue. The new production opened in December 1934 with Ralph Richardson as Mercutio and Maurice Evans as Romeo. Critics wrote that Cornell was \"the finest Juliet of her time\",  \"endlessly haunting\", and \"the most lovely and enchanting Juliet our present-day theatre has seen\". \\n\\nJohn Gielgud\\'s New Theatre production in 1935 featured Gielgud and Laurence Olivier as Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six weeks into the run, with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet.  Gielgud used a scholarly combination of Q1 and Q2 texts, and organised the set and costumes to match as closely as possible to the Elizabethan period. His efforts were a huge success at the box office, and set the stage for increased historical realism in later productions.  Olivier later compared his performance and Gielgud\\'s: \"John, all spiritual, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity\\xa0... I\\'ve always felt that John missed the lower half and that made me go for the other\\xa0... But whatever it was, when I was playing Romeo I was carrying a torch, I was trying to sell realism in Shakespeare.\" \\n\\nPeter Brook\\'s 1947 version was the beginning of a different style of Romeo and Juliet performances. Brook was less concerned with realism, and more concerned with translating the play into a form that could communicate with the modern world. He argued, \"A production is only correct at the moment of its correctness, and only good at the moment of its success.\"  Brook excluded the final reconciliation of the families from his performance text. \\n\\nThroughout the century, audiences, influenced by the cinema, became less willing to accept actors distinctly older than the teenage characters they were playing.  A significant example of more youthful casting was in Franco Zeffirelli\\'s Old Vic production in 1960, with John Stride and Judi Dench, which would serve as the basis for his 1968 film. Zeffirelli borrowed from Brook\\'s ideas, altogether removing around a third of the play\\'s text to make it more accessible. In an interview with The Times, he stated that the play\\'s \"twin themes of love and the total breakdown of understanding between two generations\" had contemporary relevance. \\n\\nRecent performances often set the play in the contemporary world. For example, in 1986 the Royal Shakespeare Company set the play in modern Verona. Switchblades replaced swords, feasts and balls became drug-laden rock parties, and Romeo committed suicide by hypodermic needle.  In 1997, the Folger Shakespeare Theatre produced a version set in a typical suburban world. Romeo sneaks into the Capulet barbecue to meet Juliet, and Juliet discovers Tybalt\\'s death while in class at school. \\n\\nThe play is sometimes given a historical setting, enabling audiences to reflect on the underlying conflicts. For example, adaptations have been set in the midst of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,  in the apartheid era in South Africa,  and in the aftermath of the Pueblo Revolt.  Similarly, Peter Ustinov\\'s 1956 comic adaptation, Romanoff and Juliet, is set in a fictional mid-European country in the depths of the Cold War.  A mock-Victorian revisionist version of Romeo and Juliet final scene (with a happy ending, Romeo, Juliet, Mercutio and Paris restored to life, and Benvolio revealing that he is Paris\\'s love, Benvolia, in disguise) forms part of the 1980 stage-play The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.  Shakespeare’s R&J, by Joe Calarco, spins the classic in a modern tale of gay teenage awakening.  A recent comedic musical adaptation was The Second City\\'s The Second City\\'s Romeo and Juliet Musical: The People vs. Friar Laurence, the Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet, set in modern times. \\n\\nIn the 19th and 20th century, Romeo and Juliet has often been the choice of Shakespeare plays to open a classical theatre company, beginning with Edwin Booth\\'s inaugural production of that play in his theatre in 1869, the newly reformed company of the Old Vic in 1929 with John Gielgud, Martita Hunt and Margaret Webster,  as well as the Riverside Shakespeare Company in its founding production in New York City in 1977, which used the 1968 film of Franco Zeffirelli\\'s production as its inspiration. \\n\\nIn 2013, Romeo and Juliet ran on Broadway at Richard Rodgers Theatre from September 19 to December 8 for 93 regular performances after 27 previews starting on August 24 with Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad in the starring roles. \\n\\nBallet\\n\\nThe best-known ballet version is Prokofiev\\'s Romeo and Juliet.  Originally commissioned by the Kirov Ballet, it was rejected by them when Prokofiev attempted a happy ending, and was rejected again for the experimental nature of its music. It has subsequently attained an \"immense\" reputation, and has been choreographed by John Cranko (1962) and Kenneth MacMillan (1965) among others. \\n\\nIn 1977, Michael Smuin\\'s production of one of the play\\'s most dramatic and impassioned dance interpretations was debuted in its entirety by San Francisco Ballet. This production was the first full-length ballet to be broadcast by the PBS series \"Great Performances: Dance in America\"; it aired in 1978. \\n\\nMusic\\n\\nAt least 27 operas have been based on Romeo and Juliet.  The earliest, Romeo und Julie in 1776, a Singspiel by Georg Benda, omits much of the action of the play and most of its characters, and has a happy ending. It is occasionally revived. The best-known is Gounod\\'s 1867 Roméo et Juliette (libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré), a critical triumph when first performed and frequently revived today.  Bellini\\'s I Capuleti e i Montecchi is also revived from time to time, but has sometimes been judged unfavourably because of its perceived liberties with Shakespeare; however, Bellini and his librettist, Felice Romani, worked from Italian sources—principally Romani\\'s libretto for Giulietta e Romeo by Nicola Vaccai—rather than directly adapting Shakespeare\\'s play.  Among later operas there is Heinrich Sutermeister\\'s 1940 work Romeo und Julia.\\n\\nRoméo et Juliette by Berlioz is a \"symphonie dramatique\", a large-scale work in three parts for mixed voices, chorus and orchestra, which premiered in 1839.  Tchaikovsky\\'s Romeo and Juliet Fantasy-Overture (1869, revised 1870 and 1880) is a 15-minute symphonic poem, containing the famous melody known as the \"love theme\".  Tchaikovsky\\'s device of repeating the same musical theme at the ball, in the balcony scene, in Juliet\\'s bedroom and in the tomb  has been used by subsequent directors: for example Nino Rota\\'s love theme is used in a similar way in the 1968 film of the play, as is Des\\'ree\\'s Kissing You in the 1996 film.  Other classical composers influenced by the play include Henry Hugh Pearson (Romeo and Juliet, overture for orchestra, Op. 86), Svendsen (Romeo og Julie, 1876), Delius (A Village Romeo and Juliet, 1899–1901), Stenhammar (Romeo och Julia, 1922), and Kabalevsky (Incidental Music to Romeo and Juliet, Op. 56, 1956). \\n\\nThe play influenced several jazz works, including Peggy Lee\\'s \"Fever\".  Duke Ellington\\'s Such Sweet Thunder contains a piece entitled \"The Star-Crossed Lovers\"  in which the pair are represented by tenor and alto saxophones: critics noted that Juliet\\'s sax dominates the piece, rather than offering an image of equality.  The play has frequently influenced popular music, including works by The Supremes, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Waits, Lou Reed,  and Taylor Swift.  The most famous such track is Dire Straits\\' \"Romeo and Juliet\". \\n\\nThe most famous musical theatre adaptation is West Side Story with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. It débuted on Broadway in 1957 and in the West End in 1958, and became a popular film in 1961. This version updated the setting to mid-20th-century New York City, and the warring families to ethnic gangs.  Other musical adaptations include Terrence Mann\\'s 1999 rock musical William Shakespeare\\'s Romeo and Juliet, co-written with Jerome Korman,  Gérard Presgurvic\\'s 2001 Roméo et Juliette, de la Haine à l\\'Amour and Riccardo Cocciante\\'s 2007 Giulietta & Romeo. \\n\\nLiterature and art\\n\\nRomeo and Juliet had a profound influence on subsequent literature. Before then, romance had not even been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy.  In Harold Bloom\\'s words, Shakespeare \"invented the formula that the sexual becomes the erotic when crossed by the shadow of death\".  Of Shakespeare\\'s works, Romeo and Juliet has generated the most—and the most varied—adaptations, including prose and verse narratives, drama, opera, orchestral and choral music, ballet, film, television and painting.  The word \"Romeo\" has even become synonymous with \"male lover\" in English. \\n\\nRomeo and Juliet was parodied in Shakespeare\\'s own lifetime: Henry Porter\\'s Two Angry Women of Abingdon (1598) and Thomas Dekker\\'s Blurt, Master Constable (1607) both contain balcony scenes in which a virginal heroine engages in bawdy wordplay.  The play directly influenced later literary works. For example, the preparations for a performance form a major plot arc in Charles Dickens\\' Nicholas Nickleby. \\n\\nRomeo and Juliet is one of Shakespeare\\'s most-illustrated works.  The first known illustration was a woodcut of the tomb scene,  thought to be by Elisha Kirkall, which appeared in Nicholas Rowe\\'s 1709 edition of Shakespeare\\'s plays.  Five paintings of the play were commissioned for the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery in the late 18th century, one representing each of the five acts of the play.  The 19th century fashion for \"pictorial\" performances led to directors drawing on paintings for their inspiration, which in turn influenced painters to depict actors and scenes from the theatre.  In the 20th century, the play\\'s most iconic visual images have derived from its popular film versions.Orgel (2007: 91).\\n\\nIn 2014, Simon & Schuster will publish Juliet\\'s Nurse, a novel by historian and former college professor Lois M. Leveen imagining the fourteen years leading up to the events in the play from the point of view of the nurse. The nurse has the third largest number of lines in the original play; only the eponymous characters have more lines. \\n\\nScreen\\n\\nRomeo and Juliet may be the most-filmed play of all time.Brode (2001: 42). The most notable theatrical releases were George Cukor\\'s multi-Oscar-nominated 1936 production, Franco Zeffirelli\\'s 1968 version, and Baz Luhrmann\\'s 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet. The latter two were both, in their time, the highest-grossing Shakespeare film ever.  Romeo and Juliet was first filmed in the silent era, by Georges Méliès, although his film is now lost. The play was first heard on film in The Hollywood Revue of 1929, in which John Gilbert recited the balcony scene opposite Norma Shearer. \\n\\nShearer and Leslie Howard, with a combined age over 75, played the teenage lovers in George Cukor\\'s MGM 1936 film version. Neither critics nor the public responded enthusiastically. Cinemagoers considered the film too \"arty\", staying away as they had from Warner\\'s A Midsummer Night Dream a year before: leading to Hollywood abandoning the Bard for over a decade.   Renato Castellani won the Grand Prix at the Venice Film Festival for his 1954 film of Romeo and Juliet.   His Romeo, Laurence Harvey, was already an experienced screen actor.  By contrast, Susan Shentall, as Juliet, was a secretarial student who was discovered by the director in a London pub, and was cast for her \"pale sweet skin and honey-blonde hair\". \\n\\nStephen Orgel describes Franco Zeffirelli\\'s 1968 Romeo and Juliet as being \"full of beautiful young people, and the camera, and the lush technicolour, make the most of their sexual energy and good looks\".  Zeffirelli\\'s teenage leads, Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey, had virtually no previous acting experience, but performed capably and with great maturity.  Zeffirelli has been particularly praised,  for his presentation of the duel scene as bravado getting out-of-control.  The film courted controversy by including a nude wedding-night scene  while Olivia Hussey was only fifteen. \\n\\nBaz Luhrmann\\'s 1996 Romeo + Juliet and its accompanying soundtrack successfully targeted the \"MTV Generation\": a young audience of similar age to the story\\'s characters.  Far darker than Zeffirelli\\'s version, the film is set in the \"crass, violent and superficial society\" of Verona Beach and Sycamore Grove.  Leonardo DiCaprio was Romeo and Claire Danes was Juliet.\\n\\nThe play has been widely adapted for TV and film. In 1960, Peter Ustinov\\'s cold-war stage parody, Romanoff and Juliet was filmed. The 1961 film of West Side Story—set among New York gangs–featured the Jets as white youths, equivalent to Shakespeare\\'s Montagues, while the Sharks, equivalent to the Capulets, are Puerto Rican.  The 1994 film The Punk uses both the rough plot outline of Romeo and Juliet and names many of the characters in ways that reflect the characters in the play. In 2006, Disney\\'s High School Musical made use of Romeo and Juliet plot, placing the two young lovers in rival high school cliques instead of feuding families.  Film-makers have frequently featured characters performing scenes from Romeo and Juliet.  The conceit of dramatising Shakespeare writing Romeo and Juliet has been used several times,  including John Madden\\'s 1998 Shakespeare in Love, in which Shakespeare writes the play against the backdrop of his own doomed love affair.  An anime series produced by Gonzo and SKY Perfect Well Think, called Romeo x Juliet, was made in 2007 and the 2013 version is the latest English-language film based on the play. In 2013, Sanjay Leela Bhansali directed the Bollywood film Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, a contemporary version of the play which starred Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone in leading roles. The film was a commercial and critical success.     In February 2014, BroadwayHD released a filmed version of the 2013 Broadway Revival of Romeo and Juliet.  The production starred Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad.  The film was released internationally in April 2014. \\n\\nModern social media and virtual world productions\\n\\nIn April and May 2010 the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Mudlark Production Company presented a version of the play, entitled Such Tweet Sorrow, as an improvised, real-time series of tweets on Twitter. The production used RSC actors who engaged with the audience as well each other, performing not from a traditional script but a \"Grid\" developed by the Mudlark production team and writers Tim Wright and Bethan Marlow. The performers also make use of other media sites such as YouTube for pictures and video. \\n\\nScene by scene\\n\\nImage:Romeo and Juliet Q2 Title Page-2.jpg|Title page of the Second Quarto of Romeo and Juliet published in 1599\\nImage:Prologue.jpg|Act I prologue\\nImage:Scene-1.jpg|Act I scene 1: Quarrel between Capulets and Montagues\\nImage:Scene 2.jpg|Act I scene 2\\nImage:Scene 3.jpg|Act I scene 3\\nImage:Scene 4.jpg|Act I scene 4\\nImage:Act I scene 5.jpg|Act I scene 5\\nImage:Miller-RomeoJulietAct1.jpg|Act I scene 5: Romeo\\'s first interview with Juliet\\nImage:Act 2 prologue.jpg|Act II prologue\\nImage:Act II Scene III.jpg|Act II scene 3\\nImage:Smirke-JulietNurse.jpg|Act II scene 5: Juliet intreats her nurse\\nImage:Act II Scene VI.jpg|Act II scene 6\\nImage:Rigaud-RomeoJuliet.jpg|Act III scene 5: Romeo takes leave of Juliet\\nImage:Opie-JulietsDeath.jpg|Act IV scene 5: Juliet\\'s fake death\\nImage:Romeo and Juliet (Act IV, scene V).jpg|Act IV scene 5: Another depiction\\nImage:Northcote-JulietAwakes.jpg|Act V scene 3: Juliet awakes to find Romeo dead']},\n",

              "  'search_context': ['No Fear Shakespeare: Hamlet: Characters\\nNo Fear Shakespeare\\nAct 1, Scene 1\\nHamlet\\nThe prince of Denmark, and a student at the University of Wittenberg. At                 the beginning of the play, Hamlet’s father, King Hamlet, has recently                 died, and his mother, Queen Gertrude, has married the new king, Hamlet’s                 uncle Claudius. Hamlet is melancholy, bitter, and cynical, full of hatred for his                 uncle and disgust at his mother for marrying him. When the ghost of                 Hamlet’s father appears and claims to have been murdered by Claudius,                 Hamlet becomes obsessed with avenging his father’s death but keeps                 thinking of reasons why he should wait before killing Claudius—then                 chastizes himself for failing to act boldly. Hamlet is a character of                 contradictions. He admires characters like Fortinbras and the Player King, who                 behave passionately and even violently for no good reason, but is himself                 thoughtful, reflective, and philosophical. At times Hamlet is indecisive and                 hesitant, but at other times he is prone to rash and impulsive acts of             violence.\\nClaudius\\nThe king of Denmark, Hamlet’s uncle. The villain of the play,                 Claudius is a calculating, ambitious politician, adept at manipulating others for                 his own ends and willing to execute, assassinate, or murder to stay in power. He                 doesn’t understand Hamlet or Hamlet’s motives, but he is quick                 to perceive Hamlet as a threat and take decisive action against him. Claudius does                 occasionally show signs of remorse and human feeling—his affection for                 Gertrude, for instance, seems sincere.\\nGertrude\\nThe queen of Denmark, Hamlet’s mother, recently married to                 Claudius. We never get to observe Gertrude on her own, so we know much more about                 how Hamlet feels about her than about how she sees herself. She seems clearly to                 love Hamlet, but Hamlet sees her as a weak, even depraved, woman motivated wholly by                 lust. Hamlet has such strong feelings about her sex life that he becomes momentarily                 distracted from his revenge quest, urging her toward a life of             chastity.\\nPolonius\\nThe Lord Chamberlain of Claudius’s court, and the father of                 Laertes and Ophelia. Polonius has good intentions, but he tends to be somewhat                 conniving and underhanded. He frequently leaps to the wrong conclusions, and his                 speeches are comically pompous and long-winded. He is completely incapable of                 figuring out what Hamlet is up to.\\nHoratio\\nHamlet’s close friend, who studied with the prince at the                 University of Wittenberg. Hamlet trusts Horatio above any of the other characters,                 valuing him for his even temper and equanimity—qualities that Hamlet                 seems to despise in himself. Horatio is loyal and helpful to Hamlet throughout the                 play. After Hamlet’s death, Horatio remains alive to tell                 Hamlet’s story.\\nOphelia\\nPolonius’s daughter, a beautiful young woman with whom Hamlet                 has been in love. A sweet and innocent young girl, Ophelia dutifully strives to obey                 her father and her brother, Laertes, allowing Polonius to use her in his scheme to                 spy on Hamlet. When her father dies, her sanity unravels, and in her madness she                 paints a scathing picture of young men as sexually exploitative and unfaithful, and                 her mad speeches about flowers conceal implied condemnations of Claudius and                 Gertrude.\\nLaertes\\nPolonius’s son and Ophelia’s brother, a young man                 who spends much of the play in France. Passionate and quick to action, Laertes is a                 foil for the reflective and agonized Hamlet.\\nFortinbras\\nThe young prince of Norway, whose father the king (also named Fortinbras)                 was killed by Hamlet’s father (also named Hamlet). Now Fortinbras wishes                 to attack Denmark to avenge his father’s honor, making him another foil                 for Prince Hamlet. Hamlet admires Fortinbras for his willingness to fight for no                 good reason.\\nThe Ghost\\nThe specter of Hamlet’s recently deceased father. The ghost,                 who claims to have been murdered by Claudius, calls upon Hamlet to avenge him.                 However, it is not entirely certain whether the ghost is what it appears to be.                 Hamlet speculates that the ghost might be a devil sent to deceive him and tempt him                 into murder, and the question of what the ghost is or where it comes from is never                 definitively resolved.\\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern\\nTwo slightly bumbling courtiers, former friends of Hamlet from                 Wittenberg, who are summoned by Claudius and Gertrude to discover the cause of                 Hamlet’s strange behavior.\\nOsric\\nThe foolish courtier who summons Hamlet to his duel with Laertes. His                 speeches are pretentious and difficult to understand.\\nVoltimand and Cornelius\\nCourtiers whom Claudius sends to Norway to persuade the king to prevent                 Fortinbras from attacking.\\nMarcellus and Barnardo\\nThe officers who first see the ghost walking the ramparts of Elsinore and                 who summon Horatio to witness it. Marcellus is present when Hamlet first encounters                 the ghost.\\nFrancisco\\nA soldier and guardsman at Elsinore.\\nReynaldo',\n",

The primary function of the soliloquy is to reveal to the audience Hamlet\\'s profound melancholia and the reasons for his despair. In a disjointed outpouring of disgust, anger, sorrow, and grief, Hamlet explains that, without exception, everything in his world is either futile or contemptible. His speech is saturated with suggestions of rot and corruption, as seen in the basic usage of words like \"rank\" (138) and \"gross\" (138), and in the metaphor associating the world with \"an unweeded garden\" (137).

According to contemporary references, Hamlet became an instant hit, and the great Shakespearean actor, Richard Burbage , received much acclaim in the lead role. Hamlet\\'s popularity grew steadily until the closing of the theatres by the puritanical government (1642-1660). During that time it was performed as an abridged playlet at taverns and inns, along with all the other great dramas that suffered at the hands of Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England. After the theatres re-opened, Hamlet was brought back to the stage by author and entrepreneur, William Davenant , and the play\\'s popularity has been constant ever since.\\n____',\n",
              "   'SparkNotes: Hamlet: Analysis of Major Characters\\nAnalysis of Major Characters\\nThemes, Motifs & Symbols\\nHamlet\\nHamlet has fascinated audiences and readers for centuries, and the first thing to point out about him is that he is enigmatic. There is always more to him than the other characters in the play can figure out; even the most careful and clever readers come away with the sense that they don’t know everything there is to know about this character. Hamlet actually tells other characters that there is more to him than meets the eye—notably, his mother, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern—but his fascination involves much more than this. When he speaks, he sounds as if there’s something important he’s not saying, maybe something even he is not aware of. The ability to write soliloquies and dialogues that create this effect is one of Shakespeare’s most impressive achievements.\\nA university student whose studies are interrupted by his father’s death, Hamlet is extremely philosophical and contemplative. He is particularly drawn to difficult questions or questions that cannot be answered with any certainty. Faced with evidence that his uncle murdered his father, evidence that any other character in a play would believe, Hamlet becomes obsessed with proving his uncle’s guilt before trying to act. The standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt” is simply unacceptable to him. He is equally plagued with questions about the afterlife, about the wisdom of suicide, about what happens to bodies after they die—the list is extensive.\\nBut even though he is thoughtful to the point of obsession, Hamlet also behaves rashly and impulsively. When he does act, it is with surprising swiftness and little or no premeditation, as when he stabs Polonius through a curtain without even checking to see who he is. He seems to step very easily into the role of a madman, behaving erratically and upsetting the other characters with his wild speech and pointed innuendos.\\nIt is also important to note that Hamlet is extremely melancholy and discontented with the state of affairs in Denmark and in his own family—indeed, in the world at large. He is extremely disappointed with his mother for marrying his uncle so quickly, and he repudiates Ophelia, a woman he once claimed to love, in the harshest terms. His words often indicate his disgust with and distrust of women in general. At a number of points in the play, he contemplates his own death and even the option of suicide.\\nBut, despite all of the things with which Hamlet professes dissatisfaction, it is remarkable that the prince and heir apparent of Denmark should think about these problems only in personal and philosophical terms. He spends relatively little time thinking about the threats to Denmark’s national security from without or the threats to its stability from within (some of which he helps to create through his own carelessness).\\nClaudius\\nHamlet’s major antagonist is a shrewd, lustful, conniving king who contrasts sharply with the other male characters in the play. Whereas most of the other important men in Hamlet are preoccupied with ideas of justice, revenge, and moral balance, Claudius is bent upon maintaining his own power. The old King Hamlet was apparently a stern warrior, but Claudius is a corrupt politician whose main weapon is his ability to manipulate others through his skillful use of language. Claudius’s speech is compared to poison being poured in the ear—the method he used to murder Hamlet’s father. Claudius’s love for Gertrude may be sincere, but it also seems likely that he married her as a strategic move, to help him win the throne away from Hamlet after the death of the king. As the play progresses, Claudius’s mounting fear of Hamlet’s insanity leads him to ever greater self-preoccupation; when Gertrude tells him that Hamlet has killed Polonius, Claudius does not remark that Gertrude might have been in danger, but only that he would have been in danger had he been in the room. He tells Laertes the same thing as he attempts to soothe the young man’s anger after his father’s death. Claudius is ultimately too crafty for his own good. In Act V, scene ii, rather than allowing Laertes only two methods of killing Hamlet, the sharpened sword and the poison on the blade, Claudius insists on a third, the poisoned goblet. When Gertrude inadvertently drinks the poison and dies, Hamlet is at last able to bring himself to kill Claudius, and the king is felled by his own cowardly machination.\\nGertrude\\nFew Shakespearean characters have caused as much uncertainty as Gertrude, the beautiful Queen of Denmark. The play seems to raise more questions about Gertrude than it answers, including: Was she involved with Claudius before the death of her husband? Did she love her husband? Did she know about Claudius’s plan to commit the murder? Did she love Claudius, or did she marry him simply to keep her high station in Denmark? Does she believe Hamlet when he insists that he is not mad, or does she pretend to believe him simply to protect herself? Does she intentionally betray Hamlet to Claudius, or does she believe that she is protecting her son’s secret?\\nThese questions can be answered in numerous ways, depending upon one’s reading of the play. The Gertrude who does emerge clearly in Hamlet is a woman defined by her desire for station and affection, as well as by her tendency to use men to fulfill her instinct for self-preservation—which, of course, makes her extremely dependent upon the men in her life. Hamlet’s most famous comment about Gertrude is his furious condemnation of women in general: “Frailty, thy name is woman!” (I.ii.146). This comment is as much indicative of Hamlet’s agonized state of mind as of anything else, but to a great extent Gertrude does seem morally frail. She never exhibits the ability to think critically about her situation, but seems merely to move instinctively toward seemingly safe choices, as when she immediately runs to Claudius after her confrontation with Hamlet. She is at her best in social situations (I.ii and V.ii), when her natural grace and charm seem to indicate a rich, rounded personality. At times it seems that her grace and charm are her only characteristics, and her reliance on men appears to be her sole way of capitalizing on her abilities.',\n",

Both Hamlet and Horatio are watching Claudius closely. When Claudius sees his own foul deed reenacted before his eyes, he is horrified and flees the stage. This convinces Hamlet that Claudius\\xa0is indeed guilty of his father\\'s murder. He tells Horatio, \"I\\'ll take the ghost\\'s word for a thousand pound.\" The importance of this scene is that it fortifies Hamlet\\'s motivation to assassinate Claudius. However, at the same time, it makes Claudius so suspicious and so frightened of Hamlet that he decides to get rid of him by sending him on a mission to England with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern carrying secret orders to the English to kill Hamlet immediately upon his arrival. Claudius still doesn\\'t know whether Hamlet is mad or pretending, but he wants him dead. Hamlet now fully intends to kill Claudius but cannot do so immediately because he has to embark for England.\\nBecause of the uproar created by \"The Mouse-Trap,\" Gertrude sends for her son to upbraid him for causing it. Polonius hides behind a tapestry to eavesdrop on their interview and ends up getting stabbed to death by Hamlet, who probably mistakes the old man for the King. Polonius\\'s murder has often been identified as the turning point in Shakespeare\\'s play. This eventually leads to the fencing scene in which Laertes uses a foil with a poisoned tip to kill Hamlet in revenge for his father\\'s death and his sister Ophelia\\'s subsequent suicide. This violent finale in which Hamlet, Laertes, Gertrude, and Claudius all die resulted from what happened in \"The Mouse-Trap\" scene.\\nSources:',\n",
              "   'Hamlet\\nWashington State University\\nHAMLET\\nMany consider Shakespeare to be the best writer who ever lived, and most consider  this to be his best work, which means that Hamlet is a strong candidate for  the honor of being the finest work ever written. Ever!\\nThere\\'s a Stationers\\' Register reference to this one in 1602 so orthodox contorters  prefer to downplay or ignore strong indications of much earlier popularity, such as  Henslowe logging in his diary a performance in 1594 (Farina 195), the wooden board  reference to the play having been produced in the courtyard at The Golden Cross in  the city of Oxford in 1593, and Thomas Nashe\\'s August 1589 reference to \"whole  Hamlets, I should say handfuls of Tragical speeches.\" Stratfordians have postulated  a so-called Ur-Hamlet from the late 1580s.\\nThe story, not particularly historical but which might perhaps be set roughly in  1050 (Asimov 80), comes from a Scandinavian folk-tale of \"Amleth,\" written down by  Saxo Grammaticus, the 13th-century Danish historian, and transported in a French  1576 version into the English play from the 1580s now lost, which some tentatively  suggest may have been Thomas Kyd\\'s, others that it was Shakespeare\\'s own first  version. Stratfordians like to imagine that the Ur-Hamlet was written by  Kyd since The Spanish Tragedy, which they also like to imagine Kyd wrote,  is another revenge play. Along with Arden of Faversham then, before he is  thirty years old, Kyd \"is credited with three of the most popular tragedies of  the Elizabethan period, which, when they are published, do not bear his name while  some indifferent things do\" (Clark 634). For a more sane Oxfordian resolution to all  this, see Eddi Jolly, \"Dating Shakespeare\\'s Hamlet.\" The Oxfordian 2  (1999): 11-23. Both Saxo Grammaticus and Belleforest\\'s French version could be  found in the library of Oxford\\'s father-in-law Burghley (Farina 196; Anderson 190).\\nThree different published Shakespeare versions create textual confusion.  One, the First Quarto from 1603, sucks:\\nTo be, or not to be; ay, there\\'s the point.\\nTo die, to sleep -- is that all? Ay, all.\\nNo, to sleep, to dream. Ay, marry, there it goes....\\nThis appears to be a reconstruction from memory on the part of some actors.\\nThis is an enormously long play, Shakespeare\\'s longest, as if Shakespeare intended  to go beyond likely dramatic production, at least in the public theaters, and get  everything into a true work of literature not simply dismissable as a play-text.  So most productions make cuts where they will.\\nRegarding the Zeffirelli Hamlet from 1990 starring Mel Gibson and Glenn  Close, one critic called the film \"Lethal weapon mets fatal attraction in what  turns out to be a dangerous liaison\" (Dawson, qtd. in Crowl 57).\\nHamlet is supposedly the most quoted figure in Western culture after Jesus, maybe  the most charismatic too (Bloom 384), and part of the experience of reading Hamlet, even for the first time, is to recognize material that somehow  you already know in its original intense context: \"the experience of Hamlet is almost always that of recognition, of recalling, remembering, or  identifying some already-known phrase or image\" (Garber 466).\\nACT I\\n\"Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.\"\\n\"Long live the King!\"\\n\"Barnardo!\"\\n\"He.\" (I.i.1-5)\\nThe first word, \"Who,\" signals a theme of questioning identity. This is a changing  of the guard during their 24-hour watch. They expect attack, as is obvious from their  paranoia, and we are not told why at first; nor are they. It\\'s a cool way to start  a play, with two characters\\' mutual defensiveness (even though we find out in the  very next line that Barnardo was expected at exactly this time!) and an insistent  reserving of one\\'s identity. \"Barnardo is told to \\'unfold\\' himself, ushering in the  cloak-and-costume imagery, and also the imagery of folded paper and writing, which  will become so predominant later in the play\" (Garber 479). The knee-jerk sloganeering  of the third line is an interesting phenomenon too under such circumstances. Thus we  start in confusion, tension, and murkiness, not sure who is in charge. And Barnardo  refers to himself in the third person, so, linguistically, identity is alienated.\\nThese characters have Italian, not Scandinavian, names. This may signify nothing more  than Shakespeare\\'s penchant for all things Italian (Asimov 80), or it may suggest that  they\\'re mercenaries. What further would that imply? And what is the significance of  one guard feeling \"sick at heart\" (I.i.9)? It certainly adds to the sense of impending  doom. Note the wintry implications here and keep track of the seasons; but remember  also \"the time is out of joint\"!\\nHoratio, a scholar and friend of Hamlet with a healthy touch of skepticism, is  asked to hear the soldiers\\' report of strange sightings. \"Sit down a while, / And  let us once again assail your ears, / That are so fortified against our story\"  (I.i.30-32). Barnardo here introduces the theme of ears and in a disturbing  aggressive metaphor. After we\\'ve been anchored in the real, practical world, and  just as we\\'re starting to hear about recent events, the Ghost itself interrupts by  showing up (less than forty lines into the play!). Now it seems as if the guards  wanted Horatio along to accept responsibility (I.i.42, 45). (Shouldn\\'t they be  following military protocol and reporting to the superior officer?) The Ghost says  nothing, and when it recedes, one guard claims, \"It is offended\" (I.i.50) -- because  of the oath \"By heaven\" in the previous line? When asked, \"Is it not like the King?\"  Horatio responds, \"As thou art to thyself\" (I.i.58-59), rendering the issue of  identity tenuous. \"This bodes some strange eruption to our state\" (I.i.69); consider  the double meaning of this utterance.\\nHoratio explains the situation (albeit his theory, really) regarding Fortinbras  and the international politics. In the previous generation, old Fortinbras of Norway  lost a battle, and lands, to old King Hamlet. Now young Fortinbras (a Hotspur  character?) may be planning a retaliation. Horatio refers to the strange signs  preceding the assassination of Julius Caesar, which makes some critics suspect  this play was written when Julius Caesar was still a recent accomplishment.  The same question arises here: there may be \"signs,\" but of what? [The reference  to a plague and a comet may suggest events of 1582 (Clark 641).] Although \"There is  no historical King of Norway by the name of Fortinbras,\" meaning \"strong-in-arm,\"  such as name \"isn\\'t so farfetched\" given Sven Forked-beard, Eric Bloodaxe, and  others (Asimov 84).\\nThe Ghost appears again and Horatio asks if it wants some kind of help, or to  convey some knowledge of national importance, or if it wants to reveal where  there\\'s a buried treasure. But a rooster crows and the Ghost recedes again.  Subsequent superstitious talk of supernatural omens adds further to the anxious  atmosphere, including reference to what was a supposed signal of the coming  \"Saviour\" (I.i.159). Doubt and uncertainty are the prevailing emotions in this  play. The word \"question\" is used 17 times in the play. And in the end Hamlet  will acknowledge that much is left unanswered.\\nSCENE ii\\nKing Claudius -- \"Shakespeare has chosen an aristocratic Roman name\" to replace  his source\\'s \"Feng\" (Asimov 87) -- speechifies about the recent funeral of his  brother and his recent marriage to the widowed Queen, Gertrude. \"His speech is  a model of policy, a masterly reduction of language to formal public utterance.  Its very first word is the politician\\'s \\'though\\' -- a conditional hedge\" (Garber  481). Claudius notes that grief and mirth are both publicly called for --  essentially announcing that two-facedness is necessary. He also slyly blames the  \"better wisdoms\" of the court council for the quick wedding (I.ii.15) and, presumably,  assumption of the throne. There\\'s no real apparent reason it should not have passed  to Hamlet: he\\'s old enough, though Asimov assures us there is nothing particularly  unusual historically in this sort of succession (87f). And the \"incest\" ought to be  touchy. This is not just Hamlet\\'s overdramatizing: it was technically considered  incest at the time. (King Henry VIII married his brother Arthur\\'s legal wife  Katherine of Aragon, but a state ceremonial purification was required.)\\nMore news from the relatively healthy Norway includes reference to Fortinbras\\'  uncle\\'s decrepitude -- a physicalization of the moral corruption of Claudius,  since the parallel is unavoidable: Claudius wants an uncle to stop a hot-headed  nephew from seeking vengeance for his father\\'s death! A peculiar bit of diplomacy,  but classic \"projection\" from Claudius.\\nThe next order of business is Laertes\\' request to return to his travels abroad.  (Laertes is the Greek name of Odysseus\\' father, but why did Shakespeare choose  this?) His father Polonius is court advisor, and although Claudius\\' praise for  the latter is peculiar (I.ii.47-49), leave is granted. This is yet another instance  of a young man wanting to leave court at the start of a Shakespeare play.\\nClaudius now turns to Hamlet, and \"They address each other with freezing,  calculated politeness\" (Asimov 91): \"But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son--\"  (I.ii.64). Hamlet\\'s first line -- \"A little more than kin, and less than kind\"  (I.ii.65) -- is a wise-crack; he can\\'t resist this kind of thing, and snots off  again immediately, insisting \"I am too much in the sun\" (I.ii.67), with a pun  on \"sun.\" He seems like a young student, maybe in his late teens, despite later  information. He\\'s a bit of a smart-aleck, shooting his mouth off, convinced of  his own passions. He can\\'t stand the stench of corruption and likes to rant  about hypocrisy. His capacity for feeling is true but he also can\\'t resist the  posture of feeling. And he plays with language hyperconsciously -- as in all  the hashing out of \"seems\" here: \"I know not \\'seems\\'\" (I.ii.76). Lots of these  are the kind of traits that drive parents crazy -- especially step-parents. But  he\\'s also right, and Hamlet does \"have that within which passes show\" (I.ii.85).\\nWe are drawn to him by his youth, his intelligence, and his vulnerability.  As soon as he appears we are conscious of one of the sources of his appeal:  his immense capacity for taking life seriously.... He has a larger-than-life  capacity for experience, a fullness of response, a depth of feeling, a vibrancy  of living, which mark him out from the ordinary. He is a raw nerve in the court  of Denmark, disconcertingly liable to make the instinctive rather than the  conditioned response. (Wells 204-205)\\nThe King\\'s attitude for grief or any situation: put on a good front as if in  control. But his pontification against excessive grief subtly includes about a  dozen insults towards Hamlet (I.ii.92ff), perhaps very indirectly suggesting  he would not be mature enough to rule a country. Claudius makes clear he would  like Hamlet not to return to school in Wittenberg -- a university not founded  until 1502 (Asimov 92). No doubt Claudius wants to be able to keep an eye on  Hamlet (I.ii112ff). He ends the ceremony with reference to a celebratory drink  (prompting Samuel Johnson to propose that here and elsewhere, Claudius seems  to be a bit of a sot).\\nHamlet\\'s first soliloquy -- \"O that this too too sallied [sullied? solid?] flesh  would melt\" (I.ii129ff) -- concerns his disgust for the seething mass of maggotry  that is humanity. He bemoans the fact that suicide is a sin, and also offers the  famous line, \"Frailty, thy name is woman\" (I.ii.146), extrapolating from his reading  of Gertrude\\'s hasty remarriage within two months of his father\\'s death. Queen  Elizabeth provoked an early poem by Oxford: \"when I see how frail these creatures  are / I muse that men forget themselves so far\" (qtd. in Ogburn and Ogburn 687).  Hamlet is rather too consumed with his mother\\'s private life, and the \"tortured  syntax\" is emotionally appropriate for his anguish (Wells 206).\\n\"But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue\" (I.ii.159). Throughout the play,  true expression of oneself and one\\'s thoughts and emotions is being capped off.  Nearly everything is done in secrecy. [The Ghost was restricted from speaking;  vows of secrecy followed, and everyone has been sneaking around since and will  continue to do so.]\\nHoratio and the guards privately inform Hamlet that they have seen the Ghost.  Hamlet grills Horatio, possibly even trying to trip him up (I.ii.239). But  Horatio is clearly on the level and Hamlet will look into this! Castiglione in The Courtier advised having \"one dependable friend,\" and Horatio will  prove to be Hamlet\\'s (Ogburn and Ogburn 632).\\nSCENE iii\\nIf Hamlet\\'s family can in any way be considered \"dysfunctional,\" this scene shows  the sick perversity of typical functional families. Mother apparently had the good  sense to die; we hear nothing of her. Brother Laertes is rather overly concerned  with what sister Ophelia does with her genitals. Daddy Polonius is a jackass,  rattling off sententious platitudes to Laertes right and left. Sanctimonious  modern-day buzzards pick over this speech for scraps to fling at us, smugly citing  the holy name of Shakespeare instead of acknowledging that these \"few precepts\"  (I.iii.58) or \"Bits & Pieces\" are being lobbed by an idiot:\\n\"Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice...\" (I.iii.68)\\n\"Neither a borrower nor a lender be...\" (I.iii.75)\\n\"to thine own self be true...\" (I.iii.78)\\n\"Looney observes that we are prone to take the phrase \\'To thine own self be true,\\'  as nobler than it can have been meant, following as it does \\'a speech which,  throughout, is a direct appeal ... to mere self-interest\\'\" (qtd. in Ogburn and  Ogburn 658). In other words, despite your natural inclinations and instincts, obey  these 114 rules, oh and just be yourself! This catalogue of advice captures the moral  schizophrenia of the play: to which self be true? Polonius has reduced real thought  to the level of the platitude. \"Modern quoters cite \\'Shakespeare\\' at their peril when  they are actually, and recognizably, quoting Shakespearean characters carefully  crafted to be at variance with their own language\" (Garber 483).\\nThe very second Laertes leaves, the hypermonitoring Polonius asks Ophelia what he had been saying  to her (I.iii.88). Regarding Hamlet, whose attentions to Ophelia Laertes wanted her to dismiss  as trifling, Polonius rejects the possibility of sincere affection; all Hamlet\\'s vows to her  are traps, \"springes to catch woodcocks\" (I.iii.115). He uses mercenary language, treating her  as a dumb commodity, in instructing Ophelia how to play stupid pointless political manuevering  games. Ophelia gets so much crappy advice in this play that finally she can\\'t act on her heart.  And her last line in the scene is: \"I shall obey, my lord\" (I.iii.136; cp. I.ii.120).\\nOur sympathies are with the younger generation in this play. The older generation is callous  and corrupt, even though they automatically have authority. The younger characters are weaker  and uncontrolled. It\\'s the agony of being young, unable to do things, and automatically not  having the right.\\nSCENE iv\\nClaudius is drinking again, Rhenish wine at this point, and Hamlet recognizes that despite  himself being a Dane and \"to the manner born\" (I.iv.15) (not \"manor,\" as often misquoted),  that \"sot\" is a bad reputation for a state leader to earn (witness Yeltsin, or Ted Kennedy):  sound political awareness on the part of a young guy who will never get a chance to be in  power.\\nThe Ghost appears, and although Horatio is worried about the danger of going over  brinks (both literally and metaphorically), and although Marcellus senses that  \"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark\" (I.iv.90), Hamlet will follow the  Ghost: \"My fate cries out\" (I.iv.81).\\nSCENE v\\nThe Ghost, who declares himself Hamlet\\'s \"father\\'s spirit\" (I.v.9) \"come to stir  him, in traditional Elizabethan and Senecan fashion, to revenge, and also a kind of  superego, a conscience-prodder, inseparable from Hamlet himself\" (Garber 469), has  been established as objectively real. However, he describes a Purgatory that certainly  sounds a lot like Hell. He announces \"Murther most foul, as in the best it is\" (I.v.27),  but still wants Hamlet to become a murderer. Hmm. Perhaps revenge makes it another matter?  The Ghost confirms Hamlet\\'s suspicions about his uncle, and despite the Ghost\\'s ranting  excessively about his wife and brother\\'s incestuous lust, Hamlet is to concern himself  only with revenge on Claudius. Although Hamlet harbors an ideal image of his father as  the embodiment of perfection and an idyllic image of the way life was, the Ghost laments  being killed before having a chance for penance, \"Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin\"  (I.v.76). The Ghost\\'s emphases, despite his message, become Hamlet\\'s own: 1) his own  sensations (poison and now), 2) fury at Gertrude, 3) Gertrude and Claudius in bed, 4)  then the murder (French 147). Actually, Laertes is more concerned with ceremony and  social forms, and may have carried out the Ghost\\'s instructions better. Hamlet will be  given to feeling self-indulgently and articulating mainly to himself all the nuances of  the experience of this situation. The ghost expects Hamlet to become another version of  himself, like the Fortinbras situation. (It\\'s been mentioned that the Ghost is rather  medieval, Hamlet renaissance.) Anyway, it doesn\\'t take a supreme intellect to eliminate  Claudius, so the role Hamlet is expected to fill does not really match him.\\nIt is almost as if Jesus had been asked to play the role of Napoleon (as the temptation in  the wilderness suggests that in some sense he was). If Jesus had been, ought he to have  accepted? The absurdity of the question prompts the recording of the strangest of all  the strange facts in the history of Hamlet: the fact, namely, that nearly all  readers, commentators, and critics are agreed in thinking that it was Hamlet\\'s duty to  kill, that he ought indeed to have killed much sooner than he did. (Goddard, I 333)\\nPouring poison in the ear serves as a nice literalization of a metaphor for this play.  It\\'s certainly what Polonius and Laertes do to Ophelia, Claudius to Laertes later, etc.  A manic Hamlet announces his absolute focus on revenge (I.v.98ff), but the possibility  seems unlikely.\\n\"Now to my word,\" he cries as he puts up his tables. Why \"word\"? Why not, \"now to  my deed\"? Because two Hamlets speak in one in an unconscious pun. By \"now to my  word\" Hamlet thinks he means \"now to my promise.\" But the Other Hamlet means \"now  to the world of words, the world of thought in contrast to the world of blood.\"  (Goddard, I 353)\\nHamlet calls his mother \"O most pernicious woman!\" (I.v.105); and, as for Claudius,  he asserts \"That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain!\" (I.v.108). He rejoins  the others and notes that \"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, / Than  are dreamt of in your philosophy\" (I.v.166-167) -- \"what we would now call \\'science\\'\"  (Asimov 105). Hamlet swears Horatio and the guards to silence about the Ghost, and no  coy hinting either (I.v.173ff). He claims he will \"put an antic disposition on\"  (I.v.172) -- don\\'t be surprised if he starts acting odd, in other words. Hamlet ends  the scene with an insightful reading: \"The time is out of joint,\" and the hint of  ambivalence about his mission: \"O cursed spite, / That ever I was born to set it  right\" (I.v.188-189).\\nHamlet is being called upon to play a role, one well-defined in the revenge-play  genre. But this theme involving the self and the role is obviously very problematic,  as one sees in countless other facets of the play. As one of my students put it:  Hamlet is \"a hero because he\\'s struggling with two morally correct contradictory  demands. It is right to kill Claudius as a Dane/Son/Prince/Liegeman/Soldier-Prince  but it is wrong to kill people as a Christian/Nobleman/Scholar/Human\" (DM). The  question is raised: acting is based on what? If supernatural instruction, then every  moron who thinks his dog is channelling Elvis will prove a vigilante. Hamlet should  perhaps not be so readily condemned for testing his suspicions, trying to find proof,  even if this paralyzes one too. On the other hand, we can\\'t wait around endlessly  for absolute proof that ozone disintegration leads to the greenhouse effect.\\nBiographical Notes\\n\"To nearly everyone Hamlet himself and the play give the impression of having  some peculiarly intimate relation to their creator\" (Goddard, I 332).  \"In some sense or other, ... Hamlet\\'s problem must have been Shakespeare\\'s\"  (Goddard, I 338). \"we are dealing with both a personal and a political  or dynastic situation\" (Garber 468).\\nThe name Hamlet, it has been pointed out, resembles helmet, or mask. \"Hamlet  is only a slightly disguised, or faintly masked Oxford\" (Ogburn and Ogburn 637).  Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford (born April 1550), had a mother who remarried  not long after her husband\\'s peculiarly sudden death in 1562. Edward was in his  teens, and she married beneath her in rank. Just as there are no truly warm maternal  figures in the plays, we get no evidence of much affection between Oxford and his  mother: she mentions him only in passing in a letter to Lord Burghley, in whose  household Oxford grew up as a royal ward. The young Oxford repeatedly petitioned  to be excused from court in order to travel, or to see military adventure, but,  except for one Scottish campaign, this was continually denied. His brother-in-law  -- Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby -- served as an English ambassador to Elsinore  early in the 1580s (Farina 197; Anderson 191). \"He was ordered to go to Elsinore  and there to invest King Frederick II with the Order of the Garter\" (Clark 635).  \"The actual setting visualized by Shakespeare seems to have been Kronborg Castle  in Elsinore,\" built in 1580 by Frederick II (Asimov 81). Shakespeare correctly  and uniquely uses the term Dansker (II.i.7), the Danish word meaning Dane  (Ogburn and Ogburn 640).\\nOxford transferred original immediate family trauma to the court, just as his life  was transferred when his father died. If the play originates in 1583, as Clark and  others suspect, then the Ghost father may also partly represent Oxford\\'s mentor and  father figure at court, the Earl of Sussex, who as Lord Chamberlain to the Queen\\'s  household from 1572 to his death in 1583 was in a position to foster and promote  Oxford\\'s playwriting efforts and help him \"stage those plays for Court performance\"  (Clark 644; cf. Ogburn and Ogburn 632). When Sussex lay dying, he is recorded as  having said of the Earl of Leicester, \"beware of the Gypsy, for he will be too hard  for you all, you know not the beast so well as I do\" (qtd. in Clark 649). Leicester  benefitted from Oxford\\'s delayed inheritance and wardship, and, compounded with his  reputation as a poisoner -- of his wife Amy Robsart, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, Lord  Sheffield, the King of Sweden, \"and many others supposed to have crossed his path or  thwarted his wishes\" including the Earl of Sussex (Clark 658) -- is often considered  the likely inspiration for Claudius. Leicester and Christopher Hatton, another  long-time enemy of de Vere, ascended at court during Oxford\\'s banishment in the  early 1580s; the Spanish Ambassador reported to King Philip, \"The Queen is completely  in the hands of these two men, Lycester and Hatton\" (qtd. in Ogburn and Ogburn 631).  Therefore, Hamlet \"is all too ready to believe that it is his father\\'s, his ancestral,  spirit, the spirit of Vere -- truth -- come to plead for vindication, here at court  where it has been so treacherously violated\" (Ogburn and Ogburn 681).\\nPolonius has long been considered a caricature of William Cecil, Lord Burghley,  with the playwright parodying Burghley\\'s long-winded advice in his Precepts to his own son, published only years after Oxford\\'s, Shakspere\\'s, and Burghley\\'s  deaths, suggesting that the playwright had to have seen it or heard this kind of  preachiness firsthand (and there\\'s no connection between Burghley and Shakspere).  The Precepts were a series of this kind of browbeating:\\nSuffer not thy sons to cross the Alps, for they shall learn nothing there but  pride, blasphemy, and atheism; and if by travel they get a few broken languages,  they shall profit them nothing more than to have one meat served up in divers  dishes.... Beware of being surety for thy best friends; he that payeth another  man\\'s debts seeketh his own decay. Be sure to keep some great man thy friend,  but trouble him not with trifles; compliment him often with many, yet small,  gifts. Towards thy superiors be humble, yet generous; with thine equals familiar,  yet respectful.... Trust not any man with thy life, credit, or estate, for it is  mere folly for a man to enthral himself to his friend. (qtd. in Clark 647)\\nPolus and Pondus were nicknames for Burghley in contemporary notes, Polus  appearing thrice in Gabriel Harvey\\'s 1578 Gratulationes Valdinenses (Atkinson, in Clark 668). In the 1603 \"bad quarto\" version of the play, the  character is named Corambis; Burghley\\'s Latin motto was \"Cor unum, via una\"  (one heart, one way), and with \"bis\" meaning twice or again, the playwright  contorts the motto with the idea of ambiguity, signifying double-dealing --  two-facedness (Ogburn and Ogburn 566). Burghley was the Queen\\'s spymaster,  a dubious honor he shared with Walsingham eventually during the reign. He was  known for his spying tactics (like Polonius). Some orthodox Shakespeareans are  trying to backpedal on the Burghley/Polonius identification these days because  of what it means regarding the authorship.\\nOphelia, in Greek, means both \"help\" and \"a source of gain,\" according to Andrew  Werth, \"Shakespeare\\'s \\'Lesse Greek.\\'\" The Oxfordian 5 (2002): 11-29 (cf.  Ogburn and Ogburn 655). \"Oxfordians recognize the reference to Burghley\\'s possible  use of his daughter Anne to gain entry into the nobility through her marriage to the  Earl of Oxford\" (Werth 21). Or as O-phelia, her name may signify \"the lover of O.\"\\nWhen Horatio and Hamlet meet again for the first time in the play and exchange  politenesses of humility, Horatio declares himself \"your poor servant ever.\"  Hamlet responds, \"Sir, my good friend -- I\\'ll change that name with you\"  (I.ii.162-163). Name? Why not \"position\" or \"ranking\" if he means the word  \"servant\"? Oxfordians suggest he means the name: \"ever\" = E. Ver, Edward  de Vere, 17th Earl of O -- Oxford.',\n",

In a supernatural episode, he discovers that his uncle, whom he hates anyway, murdered his father. In an incredibly convoluted plot--the most complicated and most interesting in all literature--he manages to (impossible to put this in exact order) feign (or perhaps not to feign) madness, murder the \"prime minister,\" love and then unlove an innocent whom he drives to madness, plot and then unplot against the uncle, direct a play within a play, successfully conspire against the lives of two well-meaning friends, and finally take his revenge on the uncle, but only at the cost of almost every life on stage, including his own and his mother\\'s.

Branagh has not condensed the acts like some mass market soup, as was done in Olivier\\'s 1948 Oscar-winning production, or in, say, Zeffirelli\\'s 1989 Hamlet lite starring Mel Gibson (both excellent, though, within their scope), but has kept every word while directing our understanding so that even those only casually familiar with the play might follow the intent and purpose with discernment. Recall that for Shakespeare--the ultimate actor\\'s playwright who wrote with precious few stage directions--interpretation was left to the direction and the actors, an open invitation that Branagh rightly accepts.\\nThe use of flashback scenes of things implied, such as the amorous union of Ophelia and her Lord Hamlet abed, or of a vast expanse of snow darkened with distant soldiers to represent the threat of Fortinbras\\' army from without, and especially the vivid remembrance in the mind\\'s eye of the new king\\'s dastardly deed of murder most foul, helps us all to more keenly appreciate just what it is that torments Hamlet\\'s soul. I also liked the intense closeups. How they would have bemused and delighted an Elizabethan audience.\\nBranagh\\'s ambitious Hamlet is also one of the most accessible and entertaining, yet without the faintest hint of any dumbing down or abbreviation. A play is to divert, to entertain, to allow us to identify with others who trials and tribulations are so like our own. And so first the playwright seeks to engage his audience, and only then, by happenstance and indirection, to inspire and to inform. Shakespeare did this unconsciously, we might say. He wrote for the popular audience of his time, a broad audience, it should be noted, that included kings and queens as well as knaves and beggars, and he reached them, one and all. We are much removed from those times, and yet, this play, this singular achievement in theatre, still has the power to transcend mere entertainment, to fuse poetry and story, as well as the high and the low, and speak once again to a new audience twenty generations removed.\\nBranagh himself is a wonderful Hamlet, perhaps a bit of a ham at times (as I think was Shakespeare\\'s intent), a prince who is the friend of itinerant players. He also lacks somewhat in statute (as we conceive our great heroes); nonetheless his interpretation of the great prince\\'s torment and his singular obsession to avenge his father\\'s murder speaks strongly to us all. Branagh, more than any other Hamlet, makes us understand the distracted, anguished and tortured prince, and guides us to not only an appreciation of his actions, wild and crazy as they sometimes are, but to an identification and an understanding of why (the eternal query) Hamlet is so long in assuming the name of action. In Branagh\\'s production, this old quibble with Hamlet\\'s character dissolves itself into a dew, and we realize that he was acting strongly, purposely all the while. He had to know the truth without doubt so that he might act in concert with it.\\nI was also very much impressed with Derek Jacobi\\'s Claudius. One recalls that Jacobi played Hamlet in the only other full cinematic production of the play that I know of, produced in 1980 by the BBC with Claire Bloom as Gertrude; and he was an excellent Hamlet, although perhaps like Branagh something less than a massive presence. His Claudius combines second son ambition with a Machiavellian heart, whose words go up but whose thoughts remind below, as is the way of villains everywhere.\\nKate Winslet is a remarkable Ophelia, lending an unusual strength to the role (strength of character is part of what Kate Winslet brings to any role), but with the poor, sweet girl\\'s vulnerability intact. She does the mad scene with Claudius as well as I have seen it done, and of course her personal charisma and beauty embellish the production.\\nRichard Briers as Polonius, proves that that officious fool is indeed that, and yet something more so that we can see why he was a counselor to the king. The famous speech he gives to Laertes as his son departs for France, is really ancient wisdom even though it comes from a fool.\\nJulie Christie was a delight as the besmirched and wretched queen. In the bedroom scene with Hamlet she becomes transparent to not only her son, but to us all, and we feel that the camera is reaching into her soul. She is outstanding.\\nThe bit players had their time upon the stage and did middling well to very good. I liked Charlton Heston\\'s player king (although I think he and John Gielgud might have switched roles to good effect) and Billy Crystal\\'s gravedigger was finely etched. Only Jack Lemon\\'s Marcellus really disappointed, but I think that was mainly because he was so poorly cast in such a role. Not once was he able to flash the Jack Lemon grin that we have come to know so well.\\nThe idea of doing a Shakespearean play with nineteenth century dress in the late twentieth century worked wonderfully well, but I know not why. Perhaps the place and dress are just enough removed from our lives that they are somewhat strange but recognizable in a pleasing way. And perhaps it is just another tribute to the timeless nature of Shakespeare\\'s play.\\nThere is so much more to say about this wonderful cinematic production. It is, all things considered, one of the best Hamlets ever done. Perhaps it is the best. See it, by all means, see it for yourself.\\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can\\'t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)\\n103 of 121 people found this review helpful.\\xa0 Was this review helpful to you?\\nYes',\n",

They tell him about a ghost they have seen that resembles the late king, Hamlet. It reappears and they decide to tell the prince. Hamlet’s uncle, Claudius, having become king, has now married Hamlet’s widowed mother, Gertrude.\\nIn the court, after envoys are sent to Norway, the prince is dissuaded from returning to university. Hamlet still mourns his father’s death and hearing of the ghost from Horatio he determines to see it for himself. Laertes, son of the courtier, Polonius, departs for France, warning his sister, Ophelia, against thinking too much of Hamlet’s attentions.\\nThe ghost appears to Hamlet and tells him that he was murdered by Claudius. The prince swears vengeance and his\\xa0friends\\xa0are sworn to secrecy as Hamlet decides to feign madness while he tests the truth of the ghost’s allegations. He rejects Ophelia, as Claudius and Polonius spy on him seeking to find a reason for his sudden strange behaviour. Guildenstern and Rosencrantz, former student\\xa0friends\\xa0of Hamlet, are summoned by Claudius and their arrival coincides with that of a group of travelling actors. The prince knows these players well and they rehearse together before arranging to present Hamlet’s choice of play before the king and queen, which will include scenes close to the circumstances of the old king’s death. At the performance Hamlet watches closely as Claudius is provoked into interrupting the play and\\xa0storming\\xa0out, resolving to send the prince away to England. Hamlet is summoned by his distressed mother and, on the way he spares Claudius whom he sees kneeling, attempting to pray. To kill him while he is praying would send his soul to heaven rather than to the hell he deserves.\\nPolonius hides in Gertrude’s room to listen to the conversation, but Hamlet detects movement as he upbraids his mother. He stabs the concealing tapestry and so kills the old man. The ghost reappears, warning his son not to delay revenge, nor to upset his mother.\\nAs the army of Norway’s King Fortinbras crosses Denmark to attack Poland, Hamlet is sent to England, ostensibly as an ambassador, but he discovers Claudius’s plan to have him killed. Outwitting this plot Hamlet returns alone, sending Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to their deaths in his stead. During Hamlet’s absence Ophelia goes mad as a result of her father’s death and she is drowned.\\nHamlet returns and meets Horatio in the graveyard. With the arrival of Ophelia’s funeral Hamlet confronts Laertes who, after attempting a revolt against Claudius, has taken his father’s place at the court. A duel is arranged between Hamlet and Laertes at which Claudius has plotted for Hamlet to die either on a poisoned rapier, or from poisoned wine. The plans go wrong and both Laertes and Hamlet are wounded, while Gertrude unwittingly drinks from the poisoned cup. Hamlet, in his death throes, kills Claudius, and Horatio is left to explain the truth to the new king, Fortinbras, who returns, victorious, from the Polish wars.',\n",
              "   'Hamlet Summary\\nACT I, scene i\\nDoubting the tales of a ghost that has twice visited them, Horatio joins Marcellus and the other guards on their midnight watch to verify or disprove their strange story. Not only does Horatio see the ghost when it appears, but he notes that it resembles the king of Denmark who has recently been buried and resolves to inform Hamlet, the king\\'s son, of the ghost\\'s appearance.\\nACT I, scene ii\\nJudging Hamlet\\'s mourning for his father to be excessive, King Claudius (Hamlet\\'s uncle) and Queen Gertrude (Hamlet\\'s mother) appeal to the prince to \"throw to earth this unprevailing woe.\" Hamlet humors them by agreeing to stay at the castle rather than returning to Wittenberg, but he remains melancholy. Left alone, however, Hamlet rages. He\\'s angry at his mother for remarrying only two months after his father\\'s death. Horatio and the guards arrive with news of the ghost, and Hamlet decides to accompany them on their next watch to see for himself.\\nACT I, scene iii\\nAs Laertes prepares to embark for France, he warns his sister, Ophelia, not to get romantically involved with Prince Hamlet who, being heir to the throne, is not free to marry a mere courtier. Their father, Polonius, arrives and offers his departing son a few words of wisdom before seconding his opinion regarding the prince.\\nACT I, scene v\\nThe ghost reveals itself as Hamlet\\'s father and urges him to avenge its \"foul and most unnatural murder\" -- unnatural because he was poisoned in his sleep by his own brother, Claudius who now wears the crown. After the ghost vanishes, Hamlet swears Horatio and Marcellus to silence.\\nACT II, scene i\\nPolonius instructs his servant Reynaldo to follow Laertes to Paris and inquire of his behavior there. Ophelia enters, frightened, and tells Polonius of a mad encounter she has just had with Hamlet who burst into her closet unannounced and pale and looking as if he had been \"loosed out of hell.\" Though Hamlet said nothing, only staring at the poor girl before retreating with an agonized sigh that \"did seem to shatter all his bulk,\" Polonius interprets this strange behavior as a sign of true love for his daughter and decides to inform Claudius.\\nACT II, scene ii\\nKing Claudius and Queen Gertrude entreat Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two of Hamlet\\'s schoolmates that they have sent for, to help them discover what weighs so heavily on the prince\\'s mind.\\nTwo ambassadors have returned from Norway and report that a potential confrontation with Fortinbras, the prince of that country, has been peaceably resolved. Claudius agrees to give the Norwegian army safe passage through Denmark for a campaign they plan to wage over some disputed land.\\nPolonius claims to have discovered the \"cause of Hamlet\\'s lunacy\" and presents to the King and Queen love letters that Hamlet has written to Ophelia. Hoping that Hamlet is merely lovesick, and this the cause of his violent mood swings, they decide to arrange some encounter between Hamlet and Ophelia in order to test the theory.\\nMeanwhile, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern present themselves to Hamlet and attempt to discover what afflicts him, but he percieves in their questions and unexpected arrival in Elsinore some deception and refuses to reveal the true reason for his strange behavior.\\nA group of traveling players arrives at the castle, and Hamlet requests a monologue of one of the players who performs it to the point of tears. Hamlet asks the players to perform \"The Murder of Gonzago\" and to insert a speech he has written. They readily agree.\\nAlone, Hamlet chastises himself for not more passionately pursuing revenge for his father\\'s murder. He wishes to be more like the player who worked himself to tears over the death of a fictional character. He plans to test the King\\'s conscience by having the players play something like the murder of his father. \"If he but blench,\" Hamlet says, \"I know my course.\"\\nACT III, scene i\\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern report to the King and Queen that they have been unable to determine the cause of Hamlet\\'s lunacy. Claudius and Polonius hide behind a curtain, hoping to observe Hamlet wooing Ophelia, but the prince, perhaps realizing that he is being watched, denies that he has ever sent her any letters. Ophelia laments his apparent madness.\\nACT III, scene ii\\nAfter instructing the players on how best to perform the play he has written for them, Hamlet lets Horatio in on his plan. He asks his friend to watch the king\\'s face carefully during the performance and mark whether he looks guilty when the players reenact the murder of his father as described by the ghost. During the play, when the Player King is poisoned, Claudius rises and, calling for light, rushes out of the theatre. Hamlet and Horatio confer, and both agree that the king did indeed betray his guilt. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern inform Hamlet that the queen wishes to speak with him in her closet. They press him again for the cause of his \"distemper,\" and he chastises them for trying to play him like a pipe.\\nACT III, scene iii\\nFearing that he has been discovered,  Claudius orders Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to escort Hamlet immediately to England. Alone, the king prays for forgiveness for his brother\\'s murder. Hamlet overhears this, but chooses not to kill Claudius until he is about some act that \"has no relish of salvation in\\'t.\"\\nACT III, scene iv\\nPolonius hides in Gertrude\\'s chamber in order to overhear her interview with Hamlet. When the prince hears a noise behind the curtain, he assumes it is Claudius hiding there and runs Polonius through with his sword, killing the old courtier instantly. Gertrude is shocked at this \"rash and bloody deed\", but Hamlet is furious at the queen for her complicity in his uncle\\'s theft of the kingdom and rebukes her for coupling with such a villain, reviling her until she begs him to speak no more. The ghost appears to whet Hamlet\\'s \"almost blunted purpose\" and urges him to console his mother, but Gertrude cannot see the ghost and thinks Hamlet has gone mad. Advising her not to be tempted again into his uncle\\'s bed, Hamlet drags the corpse of Polonius from the room.\\nACT IV, scene iv\\nEscorted by Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet speaks to a captain of the Norwegian army as it marches, under Fortinbras\\' command, across Denmark to battle Poland over \"a little patch of ground.\" Inspired by the boldness of Fortinbras, Hamlet swears, \"O, from this time forth/My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!\"\\nACT IV, scene v\\nOphelia seeks an audience with the queen. She appears to have gone mad at the news of Polonius\\' death. Laertes, having returned from Paris after learning that Hamlet has slain his father, storms the castle with a group of armed followers and demands justice.\\nACT IV, scene vii\\nA messenger informs Claudius of Hamlet\\'s return. The king and Laertes plot against Hamlet, hoping to draw him into a fencing match in which Laertes will be armed with a poisoned rapier. As a backup plan, if Laertes fails to deliver a fatal wound, Claudius will give Hamlet a poisoned cup from which to drink during the match. Gertrude interrupts their plotting with the news that Ophelia, in her madness, has fallen into a stream and drowned.\\nACT V, scene i\\nIn a churchyard, Hamlet and Horatio find two gravediggers preparing a grave. When Hamlet asks who the grave is for, the first gravedigger tells him only that it is for \"one that was a woman.\" As he clears the ground, the gravedigger produces a skull from the earth that he identifies as Yorick, the king\\'s jester who has been dead for 23 years. Hamlet tells Horatio that he knew the man and used to ride on his back as a child. The King and Queen and Laertes appear with attendants carrying the corpse of Ophelia, but the priest refuses to perform a full ceremony because her death is considered a suicide. Laertes berates the priest and leaps into his sister\\'s grave to hold her one last time. Hamlet, grief stricken at the news of Ophelia\\'s death, leaps into the grave as well. Furious at the sight of his father\\'s murderer, Laertes grapples with Hamlet who claims that \"Forty thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum.\" Hamlet and Laertes are separated, and Claudius urges Laertes to to be patient.\\nACT V, scene ii\\nHamlet explains to Horatio how he learned of the king\\'s treachery. After sneaking into Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\\'s cabin and unsealing the king\\'s official commission, he had read the decree and discovered that he was to be beheaded when they reached England. He then forged a new commission instructing instead that the bearers of the letter (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern) be put to death and sealed it with his father\\'s signet ring. As he relates this story, a courtier appears to inform Hamlet that the king has laid a wager on him, betting that the prince will not lose by more than three hits in a fencing match with Laertes. Hamlet accepts the challenge, promising to win for the king if he can. During the match, Laertes wounds Hamlet with the poisoned rapier, but they change weapons in a scuffle and Laertes is wounded with the poisoned rapier as well. Drinking from the poisoned cup that Claudius has prepared for Hamlet, Gertrude  swoons and dies. Hamlet orders that the doors be locked until the treachery is discovered, and Laertes admits the whole plan to Hamlet before dying. Hamlet kills the king and afterwards dies himself, overcome by the poison. With his last breath, he begs Horatio to \"report his cause aright to the unsatisfied.\" Fortinbras, next in line for the throne, arrives and orders his soldiers to bear Hamlet away.\\nEND OF PLAY',\n",

A tragedy is a dignified work in which the main character undergoes                     a struggle and suffers a downfall. In Shakespeare\\'s                     plays, the main character of a tragedy is usually a                     person of noble heritage. A flaw in his personality,                     sometimes abetted by fate, brings about his                     downfall. Hamlet,                       Prince of Denmark is also sometimes                     characterized as a revenge play in the tradition of                     the Roman playwright Seneca (4 BC-AD 65). Seneca, a                     tutor to Emperor Nero (AD 37-68), wrote plays that                     described in detail the grisly horror of murder and                     revenge. After Elizabethans began translating                     Seneca\\'s works in 1559, writers read and relished                     them, then wrote plays imitating them. Shakespeare                     appears to have seasoned Hamlet and an earlier play, Titus Andronicus,                     with some of Seneca\\'s ghoulish condiments.\\nComposition                                       and Publication Dates\\nShakespeare wrote Hamlet between 1599 and1601. It first                     appeared in print in 1603 in a pirated, unreliable                     version. What happened was that the publisher or a                     person acting on his behalf copied the play                     hurriedly (perhaps during a performance). The                     copyist made many mistakes and omitted some                     passages. The play was republished within the next                     two years. In 1623, friends of Shakespeare (deceased by this time) published an authentic version of Hamlet and                     thirty-five other Shakespeare plays. The 1623                     version is the one that appears in modern                     publications of Hamlet,                     with minor editorial changes in some editions. No                     reliable record exists of the date and place of the                     first performance of the play. There is a good                     chance that it debuted at London\\'s Globe Theatre,                     completed in 1599. Shakespeare was a part-owner of                     the Globe.\\nProbable                       Main Sources\\nAn important information source for Shakespeare was                     the third book of Gesta                                       Danorum (The                                       Deeds of the Danes), a Latin work by Saxo                     Grammaticus (1150?-1220?). Christiern Pedersen                     (1480-1554), a Danish humanist writer and printer,                     published the first edition of Gesta Danorum in Paris in 1514 with a different title: Historia Danica.                     Grammaticus wrote the book at the request of a                     priest named Absalon, who was the archbishop of Lund                     from 1177 or 1178 to 1201. Lund was then under the                     control of Denmark but is now part of Sweden. Gesta Danorum recounts the stories of sixty kings of Danish lands                     in Books 1 to 9 of the sixteen-volume work. Book 3                     tells the tale of Amleth (the model for Hamlet) as                     he avenges the murder of his father, Horwendil, at                     the hands of Feng.\\nIn Grammaticus\\'s tale, Amleth lives on and becomes                     King of Jutland. (It is possible that Grammaticus                     based his tale on an Icelandic saga called Amlï¿½i.) The                     Amleth tale was retold in Histoires Tragiques (Tragic Stories),                                     by Franï¿½ois de Belleforest.\\nShakespeare may also have drawn upon a lost play by                     Thomas Kyd (1558-1594), a play referred to as Ur-Hamlet (the                     prefix ur- means original), and a surviving Kyd play, The Spanish Tragedy (also                                     spelled The                       Spanish Tragedie), in which the                     presentation of the character Hieronimo could have                     inspired Shakespeare\\'s probing analysis of Hamlet.                     Regarding Ur-Hamlet, Shakespeare critic and scholar Peter                     Alexanderï¿½editor of a popular edition of the                     complete works of Shakespeare, first published in                     1951ï¿½maintains that Ur-Hamlet was actually written by                     Shakespeare between 1587 and 1589 as a draft of the                     final version of the play. Shakespeare critic Harold                     Bloom supports this contention in a 2003 book                     entitled Hamlet:                       Poem Unlimited (Riverhead Books, New York,                     page 124). Possible additional sources for Hamlet, Prince of                       Denmark are a tenth-century Celtic tale                     about a warrior named Amhlaide and an                     eleventh-century Persian tale from The Book of Kings (Shah-nameh),                                     by Abu Ol-qasem Mansur.\\nSettings\\nThe main setting is Elsinore Castle in eastern                     Denmark, on the ï¿½resund strait separating the Danish                     island of Sjaelland (Zealand) from the Swedish                     province of Skï¿½ne and linking the Baltic Sea in the                     south to the Kattegat Strait in the north. Elsinore                     is a real town. Its Danish name is Helsingï¿½r. In                     Shakespeare\\'s time, Elsinore was an extremely                     important port that fattened its coffers by charging                     a toll for ship passage through the ï¿½resund strait.\\n\\xa0\\nModern Elsinore, or Helsingï¿½r, is directly west of a                     Swedish city with a similar name, Helsingborg (or                     Hï¿½lsingborg). Within the city limits of Elsinore is                     Kronborg Castle, said to be the model for the                     Elsinore Castle of Shakespeare\\'s play. Construction                     on the castle began in 1574, when Shakespeare was                     ten, and ended in 1585, when Shakespeare was                     twenty-one. It is believed that actors known to                     Shakespeare performed at Kronborg Castle. Other                     settings in Hamlet are a plain in Denmark, near Elsinore, and a                     churchyard near Elsinore. Offstage action in the                     play (referred to in dialogue) takes place on a ship                     bound for England from Denmark on which Hamlet                     replaces instructions to execute him (see the plot                     summary below) with instructions to execute his                     traitorous companions, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\\nTone\\nThe tone of the play is somber and foreboding. The                     tone becomes clear at the outset of the play in the                     exchange between Bernardo and Francisco as they                     stand watch on the castle:\\nBERNARDO:\\xa0 ï¿½Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed,                       Francisco.\\nFRANCISCO:\\xa0 For this relief much thanks; ï¿½tis                       bitter cold,\\nAnd I am sick at heart. (1.1.9-11)\\nNote that it is midnight, that it is bitter cold,                     and that Francisco is \"sick at heart.\" Moments                     later, when Horatio enters, Marcellus tells him of a                     \"dreaded sight\" that he and Bernardo saw on two                     nights while standing watch. Horatio is skeptical.                     But when Bernardo begins to report what they saw,                     using unsettling nature imagery, Marcellus                     interrupts him when the sight appears again:\\nBERNARDO:\\xa0 Last                       night of all,\\nWhen yond same star thatï¿½s westward from the pole\\nHad made his course to illume that part of heaven\\nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself,\\nThe bell then beating one,ï¿½\\nMARCELLUS:\\xa0 Peace! break thee off; look,                       where it comes again! (1.1.47-52)\\nHaving established a dark, ominous tone or mood,                     Shakespeare then proceeds to unfold his tale.                     Revenge and death are in the air.\\nCharacters\\nHamlet: Son                     of a murdered Danish king (who was also named                     Hamlet) and nephew and stepson of the present king,                     Claudius. Hamlet suffers great mental anguish over                     the death of his father, the marriage of his mother                     to the suspected murderer (Claudius, the brother of                     the dead king), and the clash between his moral                     sense and his desire for revenge against his                     father\\'s murderer. To ensnare the killer, Hamlet                     pretends madness. Some Shakespeare interpreters                     contend that he really does suffer a mental                     breakdown. Hamlet is highly intelligent and well                     liked by the citizens, although at times he can be                     petty and cruel. Hamlet is the protagonist, or main                     character. The play centers on him and his effort to                     avenge the murder of his father.\\nClaudius:                     The new king of Denmark, Hamlet\\'s uncle and                     stepfather. He becomes king after Hamlet\\'s father,                     the previous king, is found dead in his orchard.                     Hamlet suspects that Claudius murdered him.\\nGertrude:                     Hamlet\\'s mother and widow of the murdered king. She                     continues as queen of Denmark after she marries                     Claudius. That the marriage took place within two                     months after the late king\\'s funeral deeply disturbs                     Hamlet.\\nGhost of Hamlet\\'s                       Father: An apparition of\\xa0 old King                     Hamlet.\\nPolonius:                     Bootlicking lord chamberlain of King Claudius. A                     lord chamberlain managed a royal household.\\nOphelia:                     Daughter of Polonius. She loves Hamlet, but his                     pretended madnessï¿½during which he rejects herï¿½and                     the death of her father trigger a pathological                     reaction in her.\\n\\xa0 Horatio:                     Hamlet\\'s best friend. Horatio never wavers in his                     loyalty to Hamlet. At the end of\\xa0 the play, he                     recites immortal lines: \"Good night, sweet prince,                     /\\xa0 And flights of angels sing thee to thy                     rest!\" (5.2.304-305).\\nLaertes:                     Son of Polonius and brother of Ophelia.                     Circumstances make him an enemy of Hamlet, and they                     duel to the death in a fencing match near the end the play. As a man who reacts to circumstances                     quickly, with a minimum of reflection on the meaning                     and possible outcome of his actions, Laertes                     contrasts sharply with the pensive and indecisive                     Hamlet and, thus, serves as his foil.\\nRosencrantz,                       Guildenstern: Courtiers and friends of                     Hamlet who attended school with him. They turn                     against him to act as spies for Claudius and agents                     in Claudius\\'s scheme to have Hamlet murdered in                     England. Hamlet quickly smells out their deception                     and treachery.\\nMarcellus,                       Bernardo: Officers who are the first to see                     the ghost of Hamlet\\'s father.\\nFrancisco:                     Another officer.\\nVoltimand, Cornelius, Osric: Courtiers                     who bear messages for the king. Osric informs Hamlet                     of the fencing match arranged for him and Laertes. A                     courtier is an attendant at the court of a monarch.\\nReynaldo:                     Servant of Polonius.\\nFortinbras:                     Prince of Norway, who is on the march with an army.                     In battlefield combat (referred to in the play but                     not taking place during the play), old King Hamlet                     slew the father of Fortinbras and annexed Norwegian                     territory. Fortinbras seeks revenge.\\nPlayers:                     Actors who arrive at Elsinore to offer an                     entertainment. Hamlet directs one of them, referred                     to as the First Player, to stage a drama called The Mouse-trap,                     about a throne-seeker who murders a king. Hamlet                     hopes the play will cause Claudius to react in a way                     that reveals his guilt as the murderer of old King                     Hamlet. As The                       Mouse-trap unfolds on a stage at Elsinore,                     the actors are referred to as the following:\\nPrologue:                       Actor presenting a one-sentence prologue to the                       play.\\nPlayer                         King: Actor portraying a king (whom                       Hamlet refers to as Gonzago, the Duke of Vienna).\\nPlayer                         Queen: Actor portraying the queen (whom                       Hamlet refers to as Baptista, the Duchess of                       Vienna).\\nLucianus:                       Actor portraying the king\\'s nephew and his                       murderer.\\nClowns (Gravediggers): Two peasants who dig Ophelia\\'s                     grave. The word clown in Shakespeare\\'s time often referred to a peasant or                     rustic.\\nYorick: Court jester of old King Hamlet. He                     amused and looked after the younger Hamlet when the                     latter was a child. Yorick is dead during the play,                     But his skull, which one of the gravediggers exhumes                     in Act 5, Scene 1, arouses old memories in Hamlet                     that provide a glimpse of his childhood. The skull                     also feeds Hamlet\\'s morbid preoccupation with death.\\nClaudio: Man                     who relays messages for the king and queen from                     Hamlet after he escapes from a ship carrying him to                     England.\\nMinor Characters:                     Ship captain, English ambassadors, lords, ladies,                     officers, soldiers, sailors, messengers, attendants.\\nSpecial Character                       Designations\\nProtagonist:                       Hamlet is the protagonist, or main character. The                       play centers on him and his effort to avenge the                       murder of his father.\\nAntagonists:                       Claudius is the flesh-and-blood antagonist (an                       opponent of the protagonist). He spends much of                       his time plotting against Hamlet. Another                       antagonist is an abstract one: Hamlet\\'s                       indecisiveness in acting against Claudius.\\nFoil of                         Hamlet: Laertes is the main foil of Hamlet. A foil is a character who contrasts                       sharply with another character. Laertes is                       decisive and even headstrong whereas Hamlet is                       indecisive and procrastinating.\\nPlot Summary\\nAt midnight behind the battlements at the top of                     Elsinore castle in eastern Denmark, an officer named                     Bernardo arrives to relieve Francisco, another                     officer who has been standing guard in the frigid                     air during an uneventful watch. \"Not a mouse                     stirring\" (1.1.13), Francisco reports as he leaves.                     Two other men, Horatio and Marcellus, arrive a                     moment later. Marcellus inquires, \"What, has this                     thing appeared again to-night?\" (1.1.31). The                     \"thing\" is a ghost that Marcellus says has appeared                     twice on the top of the castle to him and Bernardo.                     Horatio doubts the story, believing the specter is a                     child of their imaginations.\\nWhile Bernardo attempts to convince Horatio of the                     truth of the tale, the apparition appears againï¿½a                     ghost in the form of the recently deceased King                     Hamlet, outfitted in the armor he wore when warring                     against Norway and slaying its king, Fortinbras.                     Horatio questions the phantom. But just as quickly                     as it appeared, it disappears. Horatio, grown pale                     with fright, says, \"This bodes some strange eruption                     to our state\" (1.1.85). His words foreshadow all the                     tragic action to follow. The ghost reappears, then                     disappears again.\\nPrince Hamlet, the son of the late king, learned of                     the death of his father while studying at the                     University of Wittenberg in Germany. When he returns                     to Denmark to attend the funeral, grief smites him                     deeply. The king\\'s brother, Claudius, has taken the                     throne, even though Hamlet has a claim on it as the                     son of the deceased king. In addition, Claudius has                     married the late king\\'s widow, Gertrudeï¿½Hamlet\\'s                     motherï¿½in little more than a month after old Hamlet                     died, a development that deeply distresses young                     Hamlet. In a soliloquy, Hamlet expresses his                     opposition to the marriage, his loathing of                     Claudius, and his disappointment in his mother:\\nA little month, or                       ere those shoes were old\\nWith which she follow\\'d my poor father\\'s body,\\nLike Niobe, all tears:ï¿½why she, even sheï¿½\\nO, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,\\nWould have mourn\\'d longerï¿½married with my uncle,\\nMy father\\'s brother, but no more like my father\\nThan I to Hercules: within a month:\\nEre yet the salt of most unrighteous tears\\nHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,\\nShe married. O, most wicked speed, to post\\nWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!                       (1.2.151-161)\\nThe words incestuous                                       sheets in line 161 reflect the belief,                     prevalent in Europe at and before Shakespeare\\'s                     time, that marriage between in-lawsï¿½Claudius had                     been Gertrude\\'s brother-in-law before he married                     herï¿½was a form of incest.\\n\\xa0As a first priority as king, Claudius prepares                     to thwart an expected invasion of Norwegian troops                     under Prince Fortinbras, the son of a Norwegian king                     slain in battle years earlier by old King Hamlet.                     Fortinbras apparently has a double goal: to avenge                     the death of his father (old King Fortinbras) and to                     win back territory the Norwegians lost to the Danes.\\nIn the meantime, Hamlet\\'s best friend, Horatio,                     tells the young prince the amazing story of the                     ghost. He says two guards, Bernardo and Marcellus,                     have reported seeing on two nights an apparition of                     old King Hamlet on the top of the royal castle. On                     the third night, Horatio says, he accompanied the                     guards and himself saw the apparition. \\'\\'I will                     watch to-night,\\'\\' Hamlet says (1.2.260).\\nAnother young man at Elsinoreï¿½Laertes, son of the                     king\\'s lord chamberlain, Poloniusï¿½is preparing to                     leave for France to study at the University of                     Paris. Before debarking, he gives advice to his                     sister, Ophelia, who has received the attentions of                     Hamlet from time to time, attentions that Ophelia                     apparently welcomes. Laertes advises her that                     Hamlet\\'s attentions are a passing fancy; he is                     merely dallying with her.\\nFor Hamlet and the                       trifling of his favour,\\nHold it a fashion and a toy in blood,\\nA violet in the youth of primy nature,\\nForward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,\\nThe perfume and suppliance of a minute;\\nNo more. (1.3.8-13)\\nIn other words, Laertes says, Ophelia should be wary                     of Hamlet\\'s courtesies and flirtations. They are,                     Laertes maintains, mere trifles that are sweet but                     not lasting. Before he debarks for Paris, Laertes                     receives advice from his father, Polonius:\\nNeither a borrower                       nor a lender be;\\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend,\\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\\nThis above all: to thine ownself be true,\\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,\\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\\nFarewell: my blessing season this in thee!                       (1.3.82-88)\\nAfter Laertes leaves and day yields to night, Hamlet                     meets on the castle roof with Horatio, Marcellus,                     and Bernardo at his side. By and by, Hamlet sees the                     Ghost but is uncertain whether it is the spirit of                     his father or the devil in disguise.\\nBe thou a spirit of                       health or a goblin damn\\'d\\nBring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from                       hell,\\nBe thy interests wicked or charitable,\\nThou comest in such a questionable shape\\nThat I will speak to thee. (1.4.46-50)\\nWhen Hamlet questions the Ghost, it says, \"I am thy                     father\\'s spirit, / Doom\\'d for a certain term to walk                     the night\" (1.5.16). The Ghost tells him to revenge                     a \"foul and most unnatural murder\" (1.5.31)                     committed by Claudius. According to the Ghost\\'s                     tale, Claudius poured a vial of poison extracted                     from a plant of the nightshade family (henbane, also                     called hemblane) into old King Hamlet\\'s ear while                     the king was asleep, robbing him, \"of life, of                     crown, of queen\" (1.5.83). Claudius had committed                     the murder when King Hamlet had sin on his soul, the                     better to send him to the fiery regions of purgatory                     (in Roman Catholic theology, a place or state of                     being in which a soul purges itself of sin to become                     eligible for heaven).\\n\\xa0Hamlet makes Horatio, Bernardo, and Marcellus                     swear on the hilt of his sword (where the handle and                     a protective bar intersect, forming a cross suitable                     for oath-taking) never to reveal what they saw.                     While attempting to verify the ghost\\'s story, Hamlet                     tells the others he will pretend to be mad, putting                     on an \"antic [clownish; odd; mentally unstable]                     disposition\" (1.5.194).\\nIt is Ophelia, Hamlet\\'s beloved, who first reports                     that he has been acting strangely. She tells her                     father, Polonius, the nosy lord chamberlain, that                     Hamlet had burst in upon her while she was sewing.                     His face white, his eyes crazed, he took her by the                     wrist, peered into her eyes, then left the room.                     Polonius runs to King Claudius and repeats Ophelia\\'s                     report. Claudius suspects there is something sane                     and threatening behind Hamlet\\'s strange behavior. So                     he directs two school acquaintances of Hamlet,                     Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, to watch the prince to                     find out the truth.\\nWhen traveling actors come to Elsinore to entertain,                     Hamlet engages them to stage a play, which he calls The Mouse-trap.                     In the play, a throne-seeker uses poison to murder a                     ruler named Gonzago. Claudius\\'s reaction to the play                     will reveal his guilt, Hamlet believes, \"For murder,                     though it have no tongue, will speak / With most                     miraculous organ\" (2.2.427-428). Such a revelation                     would confirm that the ghost was indeed telling the                     truth.\\nMeanwhile, Fortinbras sends word that he will not                     make war on Denmark if King Claudius allows him to                     march through the country to invade Poland. Claudius                     agrees.\\nAfter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern fail to fathom                     the meaning of Hamlet\\'s \"madness,\" Claudius and                     Polonius secretly observe Hamlet conversing with                     Ophelia. During the conversation, Hamlet rejects and                     insults Ophelia as his apparent madness worsens. His                     words deeply wound her, and there is a question                     whether he is transferring to poor, frail Ophelia                     the loathing and anger he feels toward his mother                     for her marriage to Claudius. Claudius, unsure                     whether Hamlet pretends insanity to disguise a                     scheme or is really mad, decides to rid the court of                     his unsettling presence by sending him to England on                     a contrived political mission. There, while                     conducting the court\\'s business, he will be                     murdered.\\nWhile the actors present the play, they stage a                     murder in which an actor pours \\'\\'poison\\'\\' into the                     ear of another actor playing the ruler, Gonzago. The                     scene so unnerves King Claudius that he rises and                     ends the play abruptly. His reaction convinces                     Hamlet of Claudius\\'s guilt. Claudius murdered                     Hamlet\\'s father; there can be no doubt of it.\\nQueen Gertrude reproves Hamlet for upsetting                     Claudius by staging the play. Hamlet in turn rebukes                     her for her hasty marriage. Polonius, meanwhile, has                     positioned himself out of sight behind a wall                     tapestry (called an arras) to eavesdrop. When Hamlet                     sees the tapestry move, he stabs through it and                     kills Polonius, thinking he is Claudius. After                     Hamlet discovers his fatal mistake, the ghost                     reappears to remind Hamlet of his duty. When Hamlet                     speaks with the apparition, Gertrude cannot see the                     ghost and concludes that her son is indeed insane.                     Later she tells Claudius that Hamlet, in a fit of madness, killed Polonius.\\nClaudius sends Hamlet to England with Rosencrantz                     and Guildenstern, who carry sealed papers ordering                     Hamlet\\'s execution after the ship\\'s arrival. At sea,                     Hamlet discovers the papers in a sealed packet while                     Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are asleep and writes a                     new commission ordering the deaths of Rosencrantz                     and Guildenstern, then re-seals the papers and                     places them in the packet. The next day, pirates                     attack the ship. Hamlet escapes and hitches a ride                     with them back to Denmark. When Rosencrantz and                     Guildenstern arrive in England and present the                     sealed papers, they are executed.\\nMeantime, Ophelia, distraught over her father\\'s                     death and the apparent loss of Hamlet\\'s love, drowns                     in a brookï¿½at first floating until her clothing,                     heavy with water, pulls her down. She had climbed a                     tree and crawled out on a limb. The limb broke, and                     she fell into the water. The consensus at Elsinore                     is that she committed suicide.\\nUpon his return to Denmark, Hamlet encounters                     Horatio and they pass through a cemetery where two                     men are digging a grave. The first gravedigger sings                     as he digs and throws out a skull. Shocked, Hamlet                     tells Horatio, \"That skull had a tongue in it, and                     could sing once; how the knave jowls it to the                     ground, as if it were Cain\\'s jaw-bone, that did the                     first murder!\" (5.1.34). The man continues to dig                     and throws out another skull. Hamlet says, \"May not                     that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his                     quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his                     tenures, and his tricks? why does he suffer this                     rude knave now to knock him about . . . ?\" (5.1.40).                     After Hamlet strikes up a conversation with the                     gravedigger, the latter tells him that the second                     skull was that of Yorick, old King Hamlet\\'s jester                     when Hamlet was a child. Holding the skull, Hamlet                     recites a short speech about Yorick that underscores                     Hamlet\\'s preoccupation with death.\\nA funeral procession approaches. Hamlet is unaware                     that the body being borne aloft is Ophelia\\'s. It is                     she who will be lowered into the grave. When Hamlet                     sees her face, and when Laertes sees the face of                     Hamlet, the two men grapple, tumbling into the                     grave. Laertes means to avenge the deaths of his                     father, Polonius, and his sister, Ophelia.                     Attendants part them, and Hamlet declares,\\nI loved Ophelia:                       forty thousand brothers\\nCould not, with all their quantity of love,\\nMake up my sum. (5.1.155-157)\\nLater, in secret, Laertes and Claudius plot against                     Hamlet and poison the tip of a sword Laertes is to                     use against Hamlet in a fencing match designed as an                     entertainment. For good measure, Claudius prepares                     poisoned wine he will offer Hamlet during the match.                     Osric, a courtier and messenger of the king, informs Hamlet of the details of the match. Hamlet is                     unaware of the deadly plot against him.\\nDuring the competition, Hamlet performs brilliantly,                     and Claudius offers him the cup of wine. But Hamlet                     and Laertes fight on. Meanwhile, Gertrude takes the                     cup, telling Hamlet, \"The queen carouses to thy                     fortune\" (5.1.224) and, before the king can stop                     her, she drinks the wine. Laertes grazes Hamlet with                     the poisoned rapier, breaking his skin and                     envenoming his bloodstream. Swords wave and poke                     wildly, and the fencers drop their weapons and                     accidentally exchange them. Hamlet then wounds                     Laertes with the same poisoned rapier. Both men are                     bleeding. A short while later, the queen keels over.                     To divert attention from the drink and himself,                     Claudius says Gertrude has fainted from the sight of                     blood. But Gertrude, drawing her last breath before                     dying, says, \"The drink, the drink; I am poison\\'d.\"                     Everyone now knows that Claudius had offered Hamlet                     poisoned wine.\\nBefore Laertes dies, he reconciles with Hamlet and                     implicates Claudius in the scheme to undo Hamlet.                     Hamlet then runs Claudius through, killing him. As                     Hamlet lies mortally wounded from the poison on the                     tip of Laertes sword, Prince Fortinbras arrives at                     Elsinore with his army after his conquest of Poland.                     Hamlet tells Horatio that he wishes the crown of                     Denmark to pass to Fortinbras. Then Hamlet dies.                     Ambassadors from England arrive to report the deaths of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and Horatio                     announces that he will inform the world of the                     events leading up to the deaths of Hamlet and the                     others. While soldiers bear off the bodies in a                     solemn procession, canons fire a salute.\\nGreat                                   Buys on the Following Items at                                   Amazon.com\\nHandbags                                                    and Shoes\\nConflicts\\nConflicts drive the action in the play. The main                     external conflict is between Hamlet and the killer                     of his father, Claudius. While Hamlet is attempting                     to confirm Claudius\\'s guilt, Claudius is plotting                     and executing a plan to murder Hamlet. Hamlet is                     also in conflict with (1) his mother, whom he                     believes betrayed the memory of his father by                     marrying so soon after King Hamlet\\'s death; (2)                     Ophelia, whom Hamlet treats with perplexing and                     sometimes insulting behavior; and (3) Laertes, whom                     Hamlet outraged by killing his father. Laertes also                     believes that Hamlet indirectly caused Ophelia\\'s                     death. Finally, Hamlet is in conflict with himself.\\nClimax and                       Denouement\\nThe climax of a play or another literary work, such                     as a short story or a novel, can be defined as (1)                     the turning point at which the conflict begins to                     resolve itself for better or worse, or as (2) the                     final and most exciting event in a series of events.                     The climax in Hamlet occurs, according to the first definition, when                     Hamlet satisfies himself that Claudius is indeed the                     murderer of his fatherï¿½thanks to Claudius\\'s guilty                     response to the players\\' enactment of The Mouse-trap (The Murder of                       Gonzago). According to the second                     definition, the climax occurs in the final act                     during and just after the sword fight.\\nThe denouement is the conclusion that follows the                     climax of a play. The conclusion in Hamlet takes                     place when Prince Fortinbras arrives at Elsinore                     with his army after his conquest of Poland. Hamlet                     tells Horatio that he wishes the crown of Denmark to                     pass to Fortinbras. Then Hamlet dies. Ambassadors                     from England arrive to report the deaths of                     Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and Horatio announces                     that he will inform the world of the events leading                     up to the deaths of Hamlet and the others. While                     soldiers bear off the bodies in a solemn procession,                     canons fire a salute.\\nThemes\\nHesitation\\nHamlet has an obligation to avenge his fatherï¿½s                     murder, according to the customs of his time. But he                     also has an obligation to abide by the moral law,                     which dictates, ï¿½Thou shalt not kill.ï¿½ Consequently,                     Hamlet has great difficulty deciding what to do and                     thus hesitates to take decisive action. While                     struggling with his conscience, Hamlet time and                     again postpones carrying out the ghost\\'s decree. In                     the meantime, he becomes cynical, pessimistic,                     depressed. He tells Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I                       have of late,ï¿½but wherefore I know not,ï¿½lost all                       my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and                       indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that                       this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a                       sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,                       the air, look you, this brave oï¿½erhanging                       firmament, this majestical roof fretted with                       golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me                       but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.                       What a piece of work is a man! How noble in                       reason! how infinite in faculty! in form, in                       moving, how express and admirable! in action how                       like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the                       beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And                       yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man                       delights not me; no, nor woman neither. . . .                       (2.2.250)\\nIn his famous critiques of Shakespeareï¿½s works,                     Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834) has written:\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He                       [Hamlet] is all dispatch and resolution as far as                       words and present intentions are concerned, but                       all hesitation and irresolution when called upon                       to carry his words and intentions into effect; so                       that, resolving to do everything, he does nothing.

Shakespeare                       wished to impress upon us the truth that action is                       the chief end of existenceï¿½that no faculties of                       intellect, however brilliant, can be considered                       valuable, or indeed otherwise than as misfortunes,                       if they withdraw us from or rend us repugnant to                       action, and lead us to think and think of doing                       until the time has elapsed when we can do anything                       effectually. (Lectures                                         and Notes on Shakspere [Shakespeare] and Other                         English Poets. (London: George Bell and                       Sons, 1904, page 164)\\nInherited Sin and Corruption\\nHumans are fallen creatures, victims of the devilï¿½s                     trickery as described in Genesis, the first book of                     the Bible. Allusions or direct references to Adam,                     the Garden of Eden, and original sin occur                     throughout the play. In the first act, Shakespeare                     discloses that King Hamlet died in an orchard                     (Garden of Eden) from the bite of a serpent                     (Claudius). Later, Hamlet alludes to the burdens                     imposed by original sin when he says, in his famous                     ï¿½To be, or not to beï¿½ soliloquy, that the ï¿½flesh is                     heir toï¿½ tribulation in the form of ï¿½heart-acheï¿½ and                     a ï¿½thousand natural shocksï¿½ (3.1.72-73). In the                     third scene of the same act, Claudius compares                     himself with the biblical Cain. In Genesis, Cain,                     the first son of Adam and Eve, kills his brother,                     Abel, the second son, after God accepts Abelï¿½s                     sacrifice but not Cainï¿½s. Like Cain, Claudius kills                     his brother (old King Hamlet). Claudius recognizes                     his Cain-like crime when he says:\\nO, my offence is                       rank, it smells to heaven;\\nIt hath the primal eldest curse upon ï¿½t,\\nA brotherï¿½s murder. (3.3.42-44)\\n\\xa0In Act 5, the second gravedigger tells the                     first gravedigger that Ophelia, who apparently                     committed suicide, would not receive a Christian                     burial if she were a commoner instead of a noble. In                     his reply, the first gravedigger refers directly to                     Adam: \"Why, there thou sayest: and the more pity                     that great folk should have countenance in this                     world to drown or hang themselves more than their                     even Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient                     gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:                     they hold up Adamï¿½s profession\" (5.1.13). After the                     gravedigger tosses Yorickï¿½s skull to Hamlet, the                     prince observes: ï¿½That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the knave jowls it to the                     ground, as if it were Cainï¿½s jaw-bone, that did the                     first murder!ï¿½ (5.1.34). All of these references to                     Genesis seem to suggest that Hamlet is a kind of                     Everyman who inherits ï¿½the slings and arrows of                     outrageous fortuneï¿½ï¿½that is, the effects of original                     sin.\\nSons Seeking Revenge\\nYoung Fortinbras seeks revenge against Elsinore                     because King Hamlet had killed the father of                     Fortinbras, King Fortinbras. Hamlet seeks to avenge                     the murder of his father, King Hamlet, by Claudius,                     the kingï¿½s brother and Hamletï¿½s uncle. Laertes seeks                     revenge against Hamlet for killing his father,                     Polonius, the lord chamberlain.\\nDeception\\nDeception is a major motif in Hamlet. On the                     one hand, Claudius pretends to be cordial and loving                     toward Hamlet to conceal his murder of Hamletï¿½s                     father. On the other, Hamlet conceals his knowledge                     of the murder. He also wonders whether the Ghost is                     deceiving him, pretending to be old King Hamlet when                     he is really a devil. Polonius secretly tattles on                     Hamlet to Claudius. Hamlet feigns madness.                     Rosencrantz and Guildenstern pretend to have                     Hamletï¿½s best interests at heart while attempting to                     carry out Claudiusï¿½s scheme to kill Hamlet. After                     that scheme fails, Claudius and Laertes connive to                     kill Hamlet during the fencing match. However, that                     scheme also goes awry when Gertrude drinks from a                     poisoned cup secretly prepared for Hamlet.\\nAmbition\\nClaudius so covets the throne that he murders his                     own brother, King Hamlet, to win it. In this respect                     he is like Macbeth and Richard III in other                     Shakespeare plays, who also murder their way to the                     throne. Whether Claudiusï¿½s ambition to be king was                     stronger than his desire to marry Gertrude is                     arguable. But both were factors, as he admits to                     himself in when he reflects on his guilt: ï¿½I am                     still possessed / Of those effects for which I did                     the murder, / My crown, mine own ambition and my                     queen. . .ï¿½ (3.3.60-61).\\nLoyalty\\nHamlet is loyal to his fatherï¿½s memory, as is                     Laertes to the memory of his father, Polonius, and                     his sister, Ophelia. Gertrude is torn between                     loyalty to Claudius and Hamlet. Horatio remains                     loyal to Hamlet to the end. Rosencrantz and                     Guildenstern, school pals of Hamlet, betray Hamlet                     and spy on him.\\nMischance and Serendipity\\nHamlet ï¿½just happensï¿½ to kill Polonius. Pirates                     ï¿½just happenï¿½ to rescue Hamlet. Hamlet ï¿½just                     happensï¿½ to come across Opheliaï¿½s funeral upon his                     return to Denmark. Hamlet and Laertes ï¿½just happenï¿½                     to exchange swordsï¿½one of them with a poisoned                     tipï¿½in their duel. Gertrude ï¿½just happensï¿½ to drink                     from a poisoned cup meant for Hamlet. Fate, or                     unabashed plot contrivance, works its wonders in                     this Shakespeare play.\\nChrist-like Hamlet\\nHamlet is like Christ, Irish dramatist George                     Bernard Shaw (1856-1950) has observed, in that he                     struggles against the old order, which requires an                     eye for and eye. Christ preached against revenge.\\nMadness:                                       Pretended and Real\\nIn his attempt to prove Claudiusï¿½s guilt, Hamlet                     puts on an ï¿½antic disposition\" (1.5.194)ï¿½that is, he                     pretends to be mad. In so doing he is able to say                     and do things that confuse and perplex others while                     he conducts his murder investigation. But, in the                     process, does he really become mentally unbalanced?                     That is a question for debate. But there is no                     question that he suffers deep mental anguish                     characterized by indecision and depression.\\nNor is there any doubt that Ophelia suffers a mental                     breakdown. Like other young ladies of her time, she                     has to accept the will of the men around her: her                     father, her brother, the king, and of course Hamlet.                     She is not allowed to have a mind of her own.                     Consequently, she does not know what to do after                     circumstances isolate her. Laertes goes off to                     school, Hamlet rejects her, and then her father                     dies. Meanwhile, the king centers his attention on                     ridding Elsinore of Hamlet. It is Hamlet\\'s rejection                     of Ophelia and her father\\'s death that are the                     biggest blows to her sanity. Hamlet, disgusted with                     his mother\\'s marriage (making her, in his mind, a                     wanton who yields her body to her late husband\\'s                     brother), seems to transfer his disgust to delicate                     Ophelia, telling her, \"Get thee to a nunnery: Why                     wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?\" (3.1.125).                     Hamlet is saying that Ophelia is unworthy to marry                     and bear children, who would be sinners. Instead,                     she should enter a nunnery, a convent for nuns. Nunnery was                     also used in Shakespeare\\'s time as a slang term for                     a brothel. So it could be that Hamlet is telling                     Ophelia that she is no better than a common whore or                     prostitute. Ophelia\\'s presence in the play helps to                     reveal Hamlet\\'s thinking, in particular his                     detestation of women as a result of his mother\\'s                     hasty marriage to vile Claudius.\\nSerpentine Satan\\nImagery throughout the play dwells on Satanï¿½s toxic                     influence on Elsinore and its inhabitants.                     Particularly striking are the snake metaphors. It is                     the venom of a serpent (in the person of Claudius)                     that kills old King Hamlet. Claudius, remember, had                     poured poison into the kingï¿½s ear as reported by the                     Ghost of the old king: While ï¿½sleeping in mine                     orchard,ï¿½ the Ghost says, ï¿½A serpent stung meï¿½                     (1.5.42-43). It is a swordï¿½a steel snake, as it                     wereï¿½that kills Polonius, Hamlet, Laertes, and                     Claudius. (The sword that kills Hamlet and Laertes                     is tipped with poison.) Moreover, it is a poisoned                     drink that kills Gertrude. As for Ophelia, it is                     poisoned words that undo her. The word poison and its                     forms (such as poisons, poisoner,                     and poisoning)                     occur thirteen times in the play. Serpent occurs                     twice, venom or envenom six times, devil nine times, and hell or hellish eleven times. Garden (as a symbol for the Garden of Eden) or gardener occurs                     three times. Adam occurs twice.\\nAmbiguous Spirit World\\nIn Shakespeareï¿½s time, ghosts were thought by some                     people to be devils masquerading as dead loved ones                     and trying to win souls for Satan. It is                     understandable, then, that Hamlet is reluctant at                     first to believe that the Ghost on the roof of the                     castle is really the spirit of his father. Hamlet                     acknowledges his doubt:\\nThe spirit that I                       have seen\\nMay be the devil: and the devil hath power\\nTo assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps\\nOut of my weakness and my melancholy,\\nAs he is very potent with such spirits,\\nAbuses me to damn me. (2.2.433-438)\\nEmpty Existence\\nTime and again, Hamlet bemoans the uselessness and                     emptiness of life. He would kill himself if his                     conscience would let him, as his ï¿½To be, or not to                     beï¿½ soliloquy reveals. But as a Roman Catholic, he                     cannot go against the tenets of his religion, which                     forbids suicide.\\nTry                                      Audible and Get Two Free Audiobooks\\nHow Old Is                       Hamlet?\\nEarly in the play, Shakespeare suggests that Hamlet                     is in his teens or perhaps about twenty. But in the                     churchyard in Act 5, the first gravediggerï¿½holding                     up the skull of the late King Hamletï¿½s jester,                     Yorick, who was Hamletï¿½s childhood babysitterï¿½says                     that ï¿½this skull hath lain you iï¿½ the earth                     three-and-twenty yearsï¿½ (5.1.73). Hamletï¿½s age when                     Yorick died was about seven. According to this                     information, Hamlet should be about thirty. Whatï¿½s                     going on? Probably this: In an edition of the play                     published in the early 1600s, the gravedigger says                     Yorick has been dead for only twelve years, which                     would make Hamlet about nineteen. Here is the line                     spoken by the gravedigger in that edition: ï¿½Hereï¿½s a                     scull [skull] hath bin here this dozen yeare                     [year].ï¿½ However, in the 1623 folio edition of the                     play, Yorick has been dead for twenty-three years,                     as stated by the gravedigger. Apparently, the                     eleven-year discrepancy between the two editions was                     the result of an editing error. What it all means is                     that Hamlet is only nineteen or twenty.\\nThe                                       Women in Hamlet: Shrinking Violets\\nShakespeareï¿½s plays are well populated with strong                     women who lead or influence men. Examples are Portia                     (The Merchant of                       Venice), Cleopatra (Antony and Cleopatra),                                   Volumnia (Coriolanus),                                    Queen Elinor and Constance (King John), and Beatrice (Much Ado About Nothing). However,                                     in Hamlet,                     Gertrude and Ophelia are both weaklings who are                     dominated by men.\\nIn the second scene of the first act, Hamlet, deeply                     disturbed that his mother (Gertrude) has married                     Claudius a short time after the death of old King                     Hamlet, says, ï¿½Frailty, thy name is woman!ï¿½ (150).                     Hamlet well realizes that fickle Gertrude wants,                     needs, requires marriageï¿½impropriety notwithstandingï¿½to satisfy her                     desire for attention. As the new Mrs. Claudius, she                     is totally submissive to the king\\'s will; to offer                     an original thought that might offend him is out of                     the question. Ophelia also keeps her place. Like                     Gertrude, she is totally dependent on a maleï¿½in her                     case, her father. Even though she loves Hamlet, she                     agrees to help her father spy on Hamlet. When                     Laertes returns to Elsinore from France, she says,                     ï¿½I would give you some violets, but they withered                     all when my father died.ï¿½ In other words, Ophelia                     herself withered; her spirit died.\\nThe                                       Meaning of \"To be, or not to be\"\\nHamletï¿½s ï¿½To be, or not to beï¿½ soliloquy (3.1.66) is                     one of the most famous passages in English drama and                     one of the most-often quoted. Its fame lies partly                     in the attention it receives from the endless                     debates it has generated about what it means. It is                     currently fashionable to oppose the traditional view                     that the passage is a deliberation in which Hamlet                     is trying to decide whether to commit suicide.                     Anti-suicide champions argue that Hamlet is really                     deliberating what course of action to takeï¿½or not to takeï¿½to ravel his sleeve of woe while retaining life                     and limb.\\nWhich view is right? Probably the traditional                     viewï¿½that Hamlet is contemplating suicide with his                     bare bodkin. However, because Shakespeare carried                     ambiguity to the extreme in this passage instead of                     speaking his mind plainly, there is plenty of room                     to argue otherwise. Leading his readers through the                     tangled dendrites in Hamletï¿½s brain, Shakespeare                     bewilders his audience. Admittedly, though, it is                     jolly good fun to try to solve the passage. In the                     end, though, it appears that Hamlet is indeed                     considering suicide in this passage.\\nFemale Hamlet\\nAbout twenty centuries before the birth of                     Shakespeare, the Greek playwright Sophocles (circa                     497-406 BC) completed one of the finest plays in                     history, Electra,                     about a young woman from Greek myth who resembles                     Hamlet in temperament and who struggles against                     circumstances almost identical to Hamletï¿½s. Her                     father, King Agamemnon, had been murdered by her                     mother, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus, who                     succeeds to the throne. (Hamletï¿½s father, old King                     Hamlet, was murdered by Claudius, who succeeds to                     the throne and marries the late kingï¿½s wifeï¿½Hamletï¿½s                     motherï¿½Gertrude.) Like Hamlet, Electra seeks to                     avenge her fatherï¿½s death. But in plotting the deed                     with her brother, Orestes, she suffers deep anguish, like Hamlet, marked by bouts of melancholy. At times                     Hamlet seems a carbon copy of Electra. There is no                     evidence suggesting that Shakespeare used Sophocles                     as a source for Hamlet,                     but it would be no great surprise if a historical                     document turned up suggesting that he did.\\nWhat\\'s in a Name?\\nIt is possible that the first syllable of Hamlet\\'s                     name derives from a German word, hamm, meaning                     enclosed area. But his name could mimic the English                     word hamlet, suggesting that Hamlet is a small world                     unto himself. Claudius,                     the name of King Hamlet\\'s murderer, derives from the                     Latin word claudus,                     meaning lame. In one sense, Claudius is indeed lame.                     His evil deeds hamstring him, making him incapable                     of ruling Elsinore while Hamlet is on the prowl. Horatio,                     the name of Hamlet\\'s loyal friend, is of Latin                     origin and may well refer to the Roman poet Quintus                     Horatius Flaccus, known as Horace, whose major                     themes include love and friendship. Fortinbras, the                     level-headed Norwegian prince who arrives in                     Elsinore at the end of the play to take command and                     bring stability, may be so-named to suggest strength                     of arm (Latin, fortis:                     strong; French, bras:                     arm). Gertrude, the name of Hamlet\\'s mother, who is Claudius\\'s queen, means in old German spear (Ger-) and dear                     (-trut).                     Gertrude, of course, wounds Hamlet by marrying                     Claudius (hence, Ger-)                     but remains special to him as his mother (hence, -trut).\\nAllusion                                       to the War of the Theaters\\nBetween 1599 and 1600, two companies of boy                     actorsï¿½Paulï¿½s Boys and the Children of the                     Chapelï¿½gained enthusiastic followings in London. In                     fact, so popular did the boys become that they                     attracted large numbers of theatergoers away from                     adult acting companies. But the boy companies were                     rivals not only of their adult counterparts but also                     of each other. Ben Jonson 1572-1637), the chief                     playwright for the Children of the Chapel, despised                     the chief playwright for Paulï¿½s Boys, John Marston                     (1576-1634). They lambasted each other in allusions                     in their plays, precipitating a ï¿½war of the                     theaters.ï¿½ In the second scene of the second act of                     Hamlet, Shakespeare comments on the fascination with                     the boy actors. The occasion is the arrival of a                     company of adult actors (tragedians) at Elsinore to                     stage an entertainment, actors whom Hamlet had                     already seen in stage plays. When Hamlet asks                     Rosencrantz whether these adult actors remain as                     popular as ever, Rosencrantz says no. Here is the dialogue:\\nHAMLET:\\xa0 Do                       they [the arriving adult actors] hold the same                       estimation they did when I was in the city? are                       they so followed?\\nROSENCRANTZ:\\xa0 No, indeed, are they not.\\nHAMLET:\\xa0 How comes it? do they grow rusty?\\nROSENCRANTZ:\\xa0 Nay, their endeavour keeps in                       the wonted pace: but there is, sir, an aery of                       children, little eyases, that cry out on the top                       of question, and are most tyrannically clapped                       for\\'t: these are now the fashion, and so berattle                       the common stagesï¿½so they call themï¿½that many                       wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and                       dare scarce come                       thither.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHAMLET:\\xa0 What, are they children? who                       maintains \\'em? how are they escoted?

Hazlitt said:\\nHamlet is a name:                       his speeches and sayings but the idle coinage of                       the poet\\'s brain. What then, are they not real?                       They are as real as our own thoughts. Their                       reality is in the reader\\'s mind. It is we who are                       Hamlet. This play has a prophetic truth, which is                       above that of history.

[Hamlet) is                       the one of Shakespear\\'s plays that we think of                       oftenest, because it abounds most in striking                       reflections on human life, and because the                       distresses of Hamlet are transferred, by the turn                       of his mind, to the general account of humanity.

The Booth brothers                     were sons of Junius Brutus Booth, an actor born in                     London. The latter\\'s middle name was the same as that of the most prominent assassin of Julius                     Caesar. Ironically, Edwin and John Wilkes portrayed                     Brutus and Mark Antony in a production of                     Shakespeare\\'s Julius                                       Caesar at the Winter Garten Theatre in New                     York on November 25, 1864, the 300th anniversary of                     the birth of Shakespeare. After John Wilkes Booth                     assassinated Abraham Lincoln in April 1865, Edwin                     Booth observed the following in a published letter:\\nThe news of the                       morning has made me wretched, indeed, not only                       because I have received the unhappy tidings of the                       suspicions of a brother\\'s crime, but because a                       good man and a most justly honored and patriotic                       ruler has fallen in an hour of national joy by the                       hand of an assassin.

And I most sincerely pray that the                       victories we have already won may stay the brand                       of war and the tide of loyal blood.\\nWhile mourning in common with all other loyal                       hearts, the death of the President, I am oppressed                       by a private woe not to be expressed in words.

Often, an epithet follows a name to form                       a title, as in Ivan the Terrible, Richard the                         Lion-Hearted, or Alexander the Great.                       (The underlined words are the epithets.) Sometimes                       an epithet appears without a named person. The Great                         Emancipator, for example, is an epithet                       for Abraham Lincoln. The Brown Bomber is an epithet                       for the great African-American boxer, Joe Louis.

Should                     not the crown have passed to the dead kingï¿½s son,                     Prince Hamlet?\\nNot necessarily. In Denmark, the setting of the                     play, an elective monarchy held sway until 1660,                     when a hereditary monarchy replaced it. Therefore,                     Shakespeareï¿½s fictional Hamlet, based on a legendary Dane of the Middle Ages, could not claim the crown                     as a birthright.\\nIn an elective monarchy, court officialsï¿½noblemen in                     high standingï¿½selected the new king by vote. The son                     of a king was, to be sure, the prime candidate for                     the royal chair, and usually he won it. But the                     voting nobles had the right to reject him in favor                     of another candidate. And that was precisely what                     happened in fictional Elsinore. The nobles approved                     the kingï¿½s brother, Claudius. In a hereditary                     monarchy, the kingï¿½s oldest son automatically                     ascended the throne when his father died.\\xa0 But                     of course Danish laws do not explain why the nobles                     chose Claudius over Hamlet. Shakespeare offers no                     explanation of their vote. However, Hamlet refers to                     the election of Claudius, saying, ï¿½He that hath                     killï¿½d my king and whorï¿½d my mother, / Poppï¿½d in                     between the election and my hopesï¿½ (5.2.71-72).                     These lines appear in a passage in which                     Hamletï¿½conversing with his best friend, Horatioï¿½is                     discussing Claudiusï¿½s murder plot against him and                     his moral right to kill Claudius. The words ï¿½my                     hopesï¿½ may signify that Hamlet expected to succeed                     his father. In the same scene of the same act,                     Hamletï¿½dying from the wound inflicted by Laertesï¿½                     poisoned-tip swordï¿½again refers to the\\xa0 Denmark                     election system when he says Fortinbras should be                     the new king: ï¿½But I do prophesy the election lights                     / On Fortinbras: he has my dying voiceï¿½                     (5.2.300-301).\\nThat Hamlet did not gain accession after the murder                     of his father could have been due to one or all of                     the following reasons: (1) Claudius actively                     campaigned for the kingship, winning votes by                     promising political favors. (2) Gertrude, eager to                     remarry and remain queen, campaigned on his behalf.                     (3) The nobles perceived Hamlet as too young and                     callowï¿½and perhaps more likely to support the views                     of the common people instead of their viewsï¿½and thus                     denied him succession.\\nIn the tale on which Shakespeare based Hamletï¿½Amleth,                     a Latin work by Saxo Grammaticus (1150?-1220?)ï¿½Feng                     (the character after whom Shakespeare modeled                     Claudius) murders his brother, King Horwendil, out                     of jealousy. The opening paragraph of Amleth                     explains the cause of the jealousy:\\nHorwendil, King of                       Denmark, married Gurutha, the daughter of Rorik,                       and she bore him a son, whom they named Amleth.                       Horwendil\\'s good fortune stung his brother Feng                       with jealousy, so that the latter resolved                       treacherously to waylay his brother, thus showing                       that goodness is not safe even from those of a                       man\\'s own house. And behold when a chance came to                       murder him, his bloody hand sated the deadly                       passion of his soul.ï¿½(Eton, Oliver, trans. The Danish History of Saxo Grammaticus. London: David Nutt,                       1894.)\\nThe Amleth tale also says Feng gained favor with the                     nobles by telling lies: \"Nor did his smooth words                     fail in their intent; for at courts, where fools are                     sometimes favored and backbiters preferred, a lie                     lacks not credit\" (Eton).\\nDenmark has had three monarchical systems since the                     tenth century:\\n(1) Elective system.                       In 940, Harald Bluetooth became the first king of                       a unified Denmark under an elective system                       requiring the monarch to sign a charter                       guaranteeing a division of power between the king                       and the people.\\n(2) Hereditary system and absolutism. In 1660,                       Denmark adopted absolutism, granting the king full                       power, under a hereditary system conferring the                       right of succession on the oldest son. In 1665, a                       royal edict affirmed the hereditary system under                       the principle of primogeniture, a legal term                       referring to the right of the oldest son to                       inherit his fatherï¿½s property.\\n(3) Constitutional monarch. In 1849, Denmark                       abandoned its absolutist monarchy in favor of a                       constitutional monarchy that invested government                       power mainly in the peopleï¿½s representatives while                       retaining the king as a ceremonial figure. In                       1953, Denmark granted women the right to accede to                       the throne.\\nHamlet,                       Oedipus, and Freud\\nIn an 1899 book entitled Die Traumdeutung (Interpretation of                       Dreams) Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud                     (1856-1939), the founder of psychoanalysis,                     introduced the term Oedipus complex. This term                     describes a psychological stage of development in                     which a male child desires sexual relations with his                     mother or a female child desires sexual relations                     with her father. The child also exhibits hostility                     toward the parent of the same sex. In normal                     development, a child outgrows this desire. However,                     in abnormal development, a child may retain his or                     her sexual fixation on the parent of the opposite                     sex.\\nAfter Freud coined the term Oedipus complex,                     Shakespeare scholars noted that Hamlet exhibits the                     symptoms of this condition in his relationship with                     his mother, Gertrude, and stepfather-uncle,                     Claudius. In a soliloquy in the second scene of Act                     I, Hamlet condemns Claudius as a ï¿½satyrï¿½ (line 144)                     and agonizes over his motherï¿½s hasty marriage to                     him, saying, ï¿½O! most wicked speed, to post / With                     such dexterity to incestuous sheets!ï¿½ (160-161).                     Ample evidence exists elsewhere in the play to                     support the Freudian interpretation of Hamletï¿½s                     character while buttressing the view that Hamlet is                     mentally deranged.\\nIn coining his term, Freud drew upon the story of                     Oedipus in Greek mythology. Here is the story, in                     brief:\\n\\xa0An oracle warns King Laius of Thebes that his                     wife, Jocasta, will bear a son who will one day kill                     him. After Jocasta gives birth to a boy, Laius acts                     to defeat the prophecy. First, he drives a spike                     through the child\\'s feet, then takes him to Mount                     Cithaeron and orders a shepherd to kill him. But the                     shepherd, taking pity on the baby, spares him after                     tying him to a tree. A peasant finds the baby and                     gives him to a childless coupleï¿½Polybus (also                     Polybius), the king of Corinth, and his wife,                     Periboea (also Merope). They name the boy Oedipus                     (meaning swelled                       foot) and raise him to manhood.\\nOne day, when Oedipus visits the oracle at Delphi,                     the oracle tells Oedipus that a time will come when                     he slays his father and marries his mother.                     Horrified, Oedipus later strikes out from Corinth.                     He does not want to live anywhere near his beloved                     parents, Polybus and Periboea, lest a trick of fate                     cause him to be the instrument of their demise. What                     he does not know, of course, is that Polybus and                     Periboea are not his biological parents.\\nOn the road to Thebes, which leads away from                     Corinth, Oedipus encounters his real father Laius,                     whom he does not recognize, and several attendants.                     Laius, of course, does not recognize Oedipus either.                     Oedipus and Laius quarrel over a trivialityï¿½who has                     the right of way. The quarrel leads to violence, and                     Oedipus kills Laius and four of his attendants.\\nOutside Thebes, Oedipus encounters the Sphinx, a                     winged lion with the head of a woman. The grotesque                     creature has killed many Thebans because they could                     not answer her riddle: What travels on four feet in                     the morning, two at midday, and three in evening?                     Consequently, the city lives in great terror. No one                     can enter or leave the city. When Oedipus approaches                     the Sphinx, the beast poses the riddle. Oedipus,                     quick of mind, replies with the right answer: man.                     Here is the explanation: As an infant in the morning                     of life, a human being crawls on all fours; as an                     adult in the midday of life, he walks upright on two                     legs; as an old man in the evening of life, he walks                     on three legs, including a cane.\\nSurprised and outraged, the Sphinx kills herself.                     Jubilant, the people of Thebes then offer this                     newcomer the throne. Oedipus accepts it and marries                     its widowed queen, Jocasta. Jocasta is, of course,                     the mother of Oedipus, although no one in Thebes                     becomes aware of this fact until much later. Thus,                     the oracle\\'s prophecy to Laius and Oedipus is                     fulfilled.\\nHamlet, of course, does not marry his mother. But,                     according to Freudian interpreters of the play, he                     does desire herï¿½at least subconsciously. What is                     more, he solves a riddle of sorts, a homicide case,                     and kills his fatherï¿½that is, stepfather. However,                     unlike Oedipus, Hamlet does not live on to anguish                     over the past.\\nThe                       Feudal Age and the Castle\\nFeudalism\\nMany of Shakespeare plays, including Hamlet, are set                     in the Feudal Age. This age of kings and castles was                     born in Europe in the dawning shadows of the Dark                     Ages. After the Roman Empire collapsed in the late                     Fifth Century AD, its former territories in central                     Europe had to fend for themselves. In time, without                     the might of the imperial Roman sword to protect                     them, these territories fell prey to Viking invaders                     from the north and Muslim invaders from the south.\\nBy the 730s, the Muslims had penetrated central                     Europe through Spain. However, Charles Martel, the                     ruler of the kingdom of the Franks in northeastern                     Europe and southwestern Germany, repulsed the                     Muslims with soldiers granted land in return for                     military service as horsemen. (Horse soldiers, or                     cavalry, had the speed and maneuverability to quell                     the Muslim threat.) This arrangementï¿½granting land                     in exchange for serviceï¿½was the founding principle                     of feudalism.\\nThe Franks continued to stand as a protective                     bulwark under Martel\\'s successors, Pepin the Short                     and Charlemagne. But after Louis I the Pious assumed                     power in 813, the Franks commenced fighting among                     themselves over who should succeed to the throne.                     This internal strife, along with Viking attacks,                     resulted in the eventual breakup of the Frankish                     kingdom. In 911, Viking marauders seeded themselves                     in western France, in present-day Normandy, and took                     root. By the late 900s, much of Europe (France,                     England, western Germany, northern Spain, and                     Sicily) had evolved into a land of local kingdoms in                     which rulers took refuge behind the walls of castles                     and leased land to people willing to protect and                     maintain a kingdom against rival kingdoms or outside                     invaders. The feudal system of offering land in                     exchange for service then bloomed to full flower.\\nHow Feudalism Worked\\nThe king of a domain granted an expanse of land (fief) to                     selected men of high standing in return for a pledge of allegiance and military                       service. These men, who came to be known as great lords (or grands                       seigneurs) then awarded portions of their                     land to lesser lords, or vassals, for a similar pledge of                     loyalty, or fealty,                     as well as dues and an agreement to fight the lord\\'s                     enemies. In return, the great lord met the everyday                     needs of the vassals. Knights, highly trained mounted                     warriors, were the backbone of the great lord\\'s                     army. Failure by a great lord or a vassal to live up                     to a commitment, or warranty, was a felony, a crime                     punishable by loss of the offender\\'s title, land,                     and other assets. In severe cases, the offender                     sometimes lost his life or a limb.\\nThe estate on which a lord lived was called a manor. Peasants, or serfs, were                     attached to the land as property. They paid rents                     and taxes, farmed the land, and performed many other                     servile duties. Sometimes freemen also worked the                     land. The lord exercised full political and social                     control over his land.\\nThe Castle\\nMost of the scenes in Hamlet are set in a castle. A castle                     was a walled fortress of a king or lord. The word castle is                     derived from the Latin castellum, meaning a fortified                     place. Generally, a castle was situated on an eminence (a                     piece of high ground) that had formed naturally or                     was constructed by laborers. The high ground                     constructed by laborers was called a motte (French                     for mound); the motte may have been one hundred to                     two hundred feet wide and forty to eighty feet high.                     The area inside the castle wall was called the bailey.\\nSome castles had several walls, with smaller circles                     within a larger circle or smaller squares within a                     larger square. The outer wall of a castle was                     usually topped with a battlement, a protective barrier                     with spaced openings through which defenders could                     shoot arrows at attackers. This wall sometimes was                     surrounded by a water-filled ditch called a moat, a                     defensive barrier to prevent the advance of                     soldiers, horses, and war machines.\\nAt the main entrance was a drawbridge,                     which could be raised to prevent entry. Behind the                     drawbridge was a portcullis [port KUL ihs], or iron gate, which could be lowered                     to further secure the castle. Within the castle was                     a tower, or keep, to                     which castle residents could withdraw if an enemy                     breached the portcullis and other defenses. Over the                     entrance of many castles was a projecting gallery                     with machicolations [muh CHIK uh LAY shuns], openings in the floor                     through which defenders could drop hot liquids or                     stones on attackers. In the living quarters of a                     castle, the king and his family dined in a great hall on an                     elevated platform called a dais [DAY ihs],                     and they slept in a chamber called a solar. The age                     of castles ended after the development of gunpowder                     and artillery fire enabled armies to breach thick                     castle walls instead of climbing over them.\\nReferences                                       to Ancient Mythology\\nShakespeare often alluded or referred directly to                     figures in Greek and Roman mythology, usually to                     make a description or comparison clear or vivid. For                     example, when Shakespeare compared a man to                     Hercules, he was suggesting that the man had great                     strength and fortitude. Following are examples of                     references to mythology in Hamlet.\\nAeneas: Trojan soldier who fought against                     the Greeks in the Trojan War, a conflict that is the                     source of myths, legends, and some historical accounts. It is said to have taken place in the                     twelfth or thirteenth century BC. After the Greeks                     captured Troy, Aeneas and other Trojans escaped on a                     ship. When the ship stopped at Carthage in North                     Africa, Aeneas had a love affair with its queen,                     Dido, and told her what happened at Troy. He                     abandoned her and sailed on to Italy, where he was a                     pioneer in the development of ancient Rome.

Leto had only two                     children, the god Apollo and the goddess Artemis,                     known as Diana in Roman mythology. Because of                     Niobe\\'s boastfulness, Apollo killed her sons, Diana                     killed her daughters, and Jupiter (Zeus) turned her                     into a mass of stone on Mount Sipylus (in                     present-day Turkey). The block of stone cried tears                     ceaselessly as Niobe wept for her dead children.\\nPhoebus (3.2.102): Apollo, god of medicine, music, prophecy,                     poetry, and the sun.

It was a follower of                     the god of wine, Dionysus (Roman name: Bacchus), and                     engaged in merrymaking and lechery.\\nTellus (3.2.103): Roman name for Gaea, the Greek goddess of                     the earth.\\nTrojan Horse:                     Gigantic wooden horse constructed by the Greeks                     during the Trojan War and left before the gates of                     Troy. The Greeks presented it as a gift to the                     Trojans after pretending to abandon the battlefield.                     After the Trojans pulled the trophy inside the city                     walls, Greek warriors concealed in the belly of the                     horse descended during the night and opened the                     gates to Greeks hiding outside. Surprising the                     sleeping Trojans, the Greeks easily captured and                     burned Troy, slaughtering many of its inhabitants.\\nVulcan (3.2.48 ): Roman name for Hephaestus, the god of                     fire and the forge who made armor in his smithy on                     Mount Olympus.\\nHow                                       Shakespeare Prepared Manuscripts\\nWriting                                       Tool: Quill Dipped in Ink\\nA quill was the hollow, rigid shaft of a birdï¿½s                     feather. The word ï¿½penï¿½ is derived from the Latin                     name for ï¿½featherï¿½ï¿½ï¿½penna.ï¿½ Shakespeare and other                     writers of his day used a variety of quills that                     they dipped in an ink container (inkwell) on a stand                     (standish) that held all the writing materials. If a                     writerï¿½s pocket lacked jingle, he invested in a                     goose quill. If he could afford something better, he                     invested in a swan quill. Writers or artists who                     needed quills to produce fine lines purchased crow                     quills. Quills from ducks, eagles, turkeys, hawks                     and owls also served as ï¿½word processors,ï¿½ producing                     plays, poems, and sometimes revolution.\\nQuills were the writing instruments of choice                     between AD 500 and AD 1850. (In the ancient world,                     writers used a variety of other instruments to write                     history, literature, announcements, bureaucratic                     records, and so on. These instruments included                     shaped twigs or branches that impressed words into                     clay, mallet-driven chisels that etched words in                     stone, brushes that wrote on pottery and other                     smooth surfaces ï¿½such as plaster and animal                     skinsï¿½sharpened bone or metal that inscribed words                     on wax surfaces, and sharpened reed stems dipped in                     ink that wrote on papyrus, an Egyptian water plant                     that was dried and pressed to make thin sheets                     suitable for receiving impressions. The introduction                     of the quill in the 500sï¿½an event recorded by St.                     Isidore, a Spanish theologianï¿½greatly eased the task                     of writers, much as personal computers did when they                     replaced typewriters in the last half of the                     twentieth century.)\\nLighting: Daylight, Candlelight, Oil Lamps\\nShakespeare probably tried to do most of his writing                     during the day, perhaps near a window, because                     writing at night required lit candles or an oil                     lamp. Candles were expensive. A writer could easily                     spend a day\\'s earnings or more on candlelight                     illuminating the first draft of a poem or a                     soliloquy in a play. The alternativeï¿½oil lampsï¿½gave                     off smoke and unpleasant odors. And they, too,                     required a pretty penny to buy and fuel, and                     maintain.\\nHowever, if Shakespeare attempted to confine all of                     his writing to mornings and afternoons, he probably                     failed. After all, as a playwright and an actor, he                     had to appear for the daytime rehearsals and                     performances of his works. Like people today, he had                     a \"nine-to-five job\" that probably forced him to                     moonlight. Also, passages in his plays suggest that                     he could have been something of an insomniac                     addicted to \"burning the candle at both ends.\" In                     his book Shakespeare:                                      the Biography (New York: Doubleday, 2005),                     Peter Ackroyd speculates that as a result of his                     various employments in the theatre, [Shakespeare]                     was obliged to write at night; there are various                     references in the plays to \"oil-dried lamps,\" to                     candles, and to \"the smoakie light\" that is \"fed                     with stinking Tallow\" (Page 273).\\nWord                       Choice and Spelling\\nNo official English dictionaries existed in                     Shakespeare\\'s time. Therefore, he was free to use                     spellings and meanings that did not agree with                     accepted spellings and meanings. He could also                     choose from among words imported from Italy, France,                     and other countries by seafaring traders, soldiers,                     tourists, and adventurers.\\nWhen words did not exist to express his thoughts,                     Shakespeare made up his ownï¿½hundreds of them. Many                     of his neologisms are now in common use around the                     world. Jeffrey McQuain and Stanley Malless, authors                     of Coined by                       Shakespeare (Merriam-Webster, 1998), list                     numerous words originated by Shakespeare, including bedroom, eyeball,                       generous, investment, madcap, obscene, radiance,                       torture, unreal, and varied.\\nHundreds of words used by Shakespeare have changed                     meanings or connotations over time. For example, \"Fellow, which                     has friendly overtones for us, was insulting in                     Shakespeare\\'s day. Phrases that were metaphors to                     him have often lost their coloring with us: Since we                     seldom play the game of bowls, we overlook the                     concrete implications of \\'There\\'s the rub\\' (an                     impediment on the green).\"ï¿½Levin, Harry. \"General                     Introduction.\" The                                       Riverside Shakespeare.

Boston: Houghton Mifflin, page 9.)\\nSources and                       Settings\\nTo write his plays, Shakespeare borrowed from                     history, Greek and Roman mythology, and literary                     works, then used his genius to enliven histories and                     myths and improve on plots, reworking them and                     sometimes adding new characters.\\nBecause settings on an Elizabethan stage were spare,                     Shakespeare had to write descriptions of them into                     his dialogue. This handicap proved to be a boon, for                     it motivated Shakespeare to write some of his best                     descriptions.\\nWhenever place or                       time mattered [in a Shakespeare play], some                       references to them could be introduced into the                       dialogue, and if special atmospheric or dramatic                       effects were needed, they could be created by the                       poet\\'s pen. Hence, it is to the Elizabethan stage                       that we are indebted in great measure for the                       exquisite descriptive poetry of Shakespeare. Such                       conditions, moreover, encouraged a greater                       imaginative cooperation on the part of the                       audience in the production of a play, and this                       active participation was further increased by the                       informality of the platform stage.

After writing out a manuscript,                     Shakespeare (or a professional scribe) made a copy                     of it in which obvious errors were corrected. An                     acting company could alter a playwright\\'s manuscript                     with or without his approval. It is possible that                     editors improved some of Shakespeare\\'s manuscripts.                     It is also possible that they weakened manuscripts.                     The original manuscript was called the \"foul papers\"                     because of the blots and crossouts on it. The new                     version was called a \"fair copy.\" It was submitted                     to the Master of Revels, a government censor who                     examined it for material offensive to the crown. If                     approved, the fair copy became known as a \"prompt                     copy,\" which the actors used to memorize their                     lines. The acting company bought the prompt copy,                     gaining sole possession of it, after paying the                     writer. The company then wrote in the stage                     directions (exit, enter, etc.). John Russell Brown,                     author of Shakespeare                                      and His Theatre (New York: Lothrop, Lee and                     Shepard, 1982, page 31) discusses the circumstances                     under which the censor forbade the staging of one of                     Shakespeare\\'s plays:\\nAt a time of unrest,                       when the Earl of Essex was challenging the Queen\\'s                       [Elizabeth\\'s] authority and armed bands terrorized                       the streets of London, the Chamberlain\\'s Men                       [Shakespeare\\'s company] were forbidden to perform                       Richard II, a play already licensed and performed,                       because it contained a scene in which a king is                       compelled to renounce his crown; in 1601, the                       queen\\'s counsellors believed that this might                       encourage her enemies and spark off a revolution.                       The theatre was taken very seriously by the                       authorities and was allowed to deal with political                       issues only if they did not refer too obviously to                       current affairs or seditious ideas, but were set,                       safely, in an earlier century or, better still, in                       ancient Rome or foreign countries.\\nNo original copy, or foul papers, of a Shakespeare                     play has survived to the present day except for a few pages of Sir                       Thomas More, partly written by Shakespeare.                     Fredson Bowers explains why the manuscripts were                     lost:\\nNo Shakespeare                       manuscript is in existence. This is not                       surprising: they were not collectors\\' items.                       Printers would have thrown them away after setting                       type from them; almost twenty years passed in the                       Commonwealth with no public performances of plays,                       and the manuscripts of the disbanded theatrical                       companies were completely dispersed; the Great                       Fire of London must have destroyed some. Indeed,                       only a relative handful of the hundreds and                       hundreds of Elizabethan plays have come down to us                       in manuscript form, and it is our bad luck that so                       few of these are by major dramatists. None is                       Shakespeare\\'s if we except the good possibility                       that one scene in the manuscript of the unacted Sir Thomas More is in his hand.ï¿½Bowers, Fredson. \\'\\'What                       Shakespeare Wrote.\\'\\' Approaches to Shakespeare, by                       Norma Rabkin. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1964 (page                       266).\\nWriting Format:                                       Verse, Prose, and Poetry\\nShakespeare wrote his plays partly in verse and                     partly in prose, freely alternating between the two                     in the same acts and scenes. It is not unusual, in                     fact, for one character to address a second                     character in verse while the second character                     responds in prose. Sometimes, the same character                     speaks in verse in one moment and in prose in                     another.\\nVerse is a collection of lines that follow a                     regular, rhythmic pattern. In Shakespeare, this                     pattern is usually iambic pentameter, a rhythm                     scheme in which each line has five pairs of                     syllables. Each pair consists of an unstressed                     syllable followed by a stressed syllable. Verse                     resembles poetry. Prose, on the other hand, is the                     everyday language of conversation, letters,                     lectures, sermons, newspaper articles, book                     chapters, and encyclopedia articles. Prose has no                     rhyme or metric scheme.\\nWhy did Shakespeare mix verse (including poetry) and                     prose in his plays? That is a question that                     inevitably occupies anyone studying Shakespeareï¿½s                     writing techniques. Before considering that                     question, the Shakespeare analyst first needs to                     learn how to identify the verse and prose passages                     in a play. That task is easy. Hereï¿½s why:\\nIn most modern editions of the plays, each line in                     multi-line verse passages begins with a capital                     letter, and each line in multi-line prose passages                     begins with a small letter except the first line or                     a line beginning with the opening word of a                     sentence. In addition, verse passages have a                     shortened right margin, but prose passages have a                     full right margin. Following are examples of these                     visual cues in verse and prose passages from Hamlet:\\nVerse Passage                       Spoken by Hamlet\\nLook here, upon this picture, and on                       this;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe counterfeit presentment of two                       brothers.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSee, what a grace was seated on this                       brow;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHyperionï¿½s curls, the front of Jove                       himself,\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAn eye like Mars, to threaten and                       command,\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA station like the herald                       Mercury\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNew-lighted on a heaven-kissing                       hill,\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA combination and a form indeed,\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhere every god did seem to set his                       seal,\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo give the world assurance of a man. (3.4.63-72)\\nProse Passage Spoken by Hamlet\\nAlas! poor Yorick. I knew him, Horatio; a fellow                       of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy; he hath                       borne me on his back a thousand times; and now,                       how abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge                       rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes                       now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of                       merriment, that were wont to set the table on a                       roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning?                       quite chapfallen? Now get you to my ladyï¿½s                       chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch                       thick, to this favour she must come; make her                       laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell me one                       thing. (5.1.80)\\nNow, then, what about single linesï¿½those spoken in                     conversation as questions or replies? They are in                     prose if one line has no paired rhyming line or is                     too abrupt to contain a rhythmic or rhyming pattern.                     The following exchange between Macbeth and Lady                     Macbeth contains such short lines.\\nHORATIO: Friends to                       this ground.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\nMARCELLUS: And liegemen to the Dane.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFRANCISCO: Give you good-night.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\nHORATIO: A piece of him.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\nBERNARDO: Welcome, Horatio; welcome, good                       Marcellus.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMARCELLUS: What! has this thing appearï¿½d again                       to-night?\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\nBERNARDO: I have seen nothing. (1.1.19-31) \\xa0\\nBut what of the multi-line passages? Why are some in                     verse and others in prose? The answer some                     Shakespeare commentators provideï¿½an answer that is                     simplistic and not wholly accurateï¿½is that                     Shakespeare reserved verse for noble, highborn                     characters and prose for common, lowborn characters.                     It is true that royalty and nobility often speak in                     verse and that peasants and commoners often speak in                     prose. But it is also true that noble characters                     sometimes speak in prose and that lowborn                     characters, like the witches in Macbeth, often                     speak in verse. Why, then, does Shakespeare                     alternate between verse and prose?\\nShakespeare                                       used verse to do the following:\\n(1) Present a play with an elegant format that was a                     tradition of the times. He also used verse to                     express deep emotion requiring elevated language.                     Because nobles and commoners were both capable of                     experiencing profound emotion, both expressed their                     emotions in verse from time to time.\\n(2) Make wise and penetrating observations or                     reflect in soliloquies on one\\'s response or reaction                     to conditions and circumstances. For example, in the                     following soliloquy, Hamlet reflects on his failure                     to act decisively to gain revenge against Claudius.                     He chastises himself for not being like those who                     act without delay even on trivial matters.\\nHow all occasions do                       inform against me,\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnd spur my dull revenge!

Lear shifts from measured verse to rambling,                     aimless, slapdash prose to reflect the deterioration                     of his mind.

In Shakespeareï¿½s day, verse (and                     its elegant cousin, poetry) was the sine qua non of                     successful writing. As an innovator, Shakespeare may                     have wanted to tout the merits of prose. Thus, on                     occasion, he infused his plays with prose passages                     so graceful and thought-provoking that they equaled,                     and sometimes even surpassed, the majesty of verse                     or poetry passages. Such a prose passage is the                     following, spoken in Hamlet by the title character:\\nWhat a piece of                       work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite                       in faculty! in form and moving how express and                       admirable! in action how like an angel! in                       apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the                       world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,                       what is this quintessence of dust? man delights                       not me: no, nor woman neither, though by your                       smiling you seem to say so. (2.2.250)',\n",
              "   'William Shakespeare: Hamnet & <i>Hamlet</i>\\nNEXT\\xa0\\nIn 1601 Shakespeare wrote Hamlet . What prompted this mournful, melancholy play, whose main character\\'s first actions alone on stage are to contemplate suicide, mourning \"How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable / Seem to me all the uses of this world\"? 15 Some believe the 1596 death from an unknown illness of Shakespeare\\'s 11-year-old son—the intriguingly named Hamnet—prompted the dark tone in the playwright\\'s later works. Other scholars think that the death of Shakespeare\\'s father in 1601—the same year he wrote Hamlet —inspired his exploration of a grieving son. These are both plausible explanations, but there\\'s simply no way to say for sure if they are true. It is clear that after Hamlet , the plays took a distinctly darker tone for the next few years. Othello , King Lear , and Macbeth covered murder, jealousy, pride and betrayal.\\nQueen Elizabeth died in 1603, ending the Elizabethan era and ushering in the Jacobean age. Her successor, King James I (previously King James VI of Scotland) was equally enamored of Shakespeare\\'s troupe. The players changed their name to the King\\'s Men and performed before the royal court a whopping eleven times in a single year. In 1608, the troupe moved their primary playing house from the Globe to the indoor Blackfriars Theatre in London. Shakespeare was nearing retirement. His final plays— Henry VIII , Two Noble Kinsmen , and the now-lost Cardenio—were written in collaboration with John Fletcher , his replacement as the King\\'s Men\\'s chief dramatist.\\nThe golden age of the King\\'s Men was coming to an end. During a 1613 performance of Henry VIII—possibly the premiere—disaster struck the Globe. Fireworks fired off to mark the king\\'s entry on stage sparked the thatch roof, and the wooden Globe burned to the ground in less than an hour. Despite the total destruction of the theater, no lives were lost thanks to patrons\\' quick thinking. \"Only one man had his breeches set on fire,\" a witness to the fire noted, \"that would perhaps have broyled him, if he had not by the benefit of a provident wit put it out with bottle Ale.\" 16',\n",
              "   'Queen Gertrude Character Analysis (Hamlet) | Online Homework Help | SchoolWorkHelper\\nQueen Gertrude Character Analysis (Hamlet)\\nYou are here:\\nPDF\\nAnalysis #1\\nGertrude is a character in the Shakespearian play Hamlet. She is the mother/aunt of Hamlet, and she is also the wife/ex-sister-in-law of King Claudius. In the play Gertrude demonstrates many characteristics and traits as the play progresses. She is a very caring character when Hamlet\\nis thinking about going back to Wittenberg for reasons that are unknown, Gertrude tells Hamlet, “Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet; I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg\" (1.2,18-19). She is also confused because she wants to love two people who dislike each other, Hamlet and Claudius, so she tries to satisfy both men. After Hamlet stabs Polonius to his death, Gertrude goes to Claudius, “Branish apprehension kills the unseen good old man\" (4.1.11-12). After Hamlet tells her that he is only acting mad, she lies to the king when he asks if Hamlet is fine, “Mad as the sea and wind when both contend\" (4.1.7). Thus showing how she is trying to help both her love ones by distrusting one and lying to the other. Throughout the play she is known as an ignorant character because she is not aware of anything that is happening. She is not aware that King Hamlet’s murder was by his own brother Claudius, even when all of Denmark was already suspicious of Claudius. Another situation that she is unaware of is when Claudius and Laertes make plans to put poison into Hamlet’s goblet, which ends up killing her. Overall her ignorant trait causes her death. Gertrude is express as a sexually active woman in the play as Hamlet’s Soliloquy tells, “She married; O most wicked speed, to post\" (1.2.156). Another situation where Hamlet assumes she remarries for her sexual needs, “O shame! Where is thy blush? Rebellious hell, if thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones, to flaming youth let virtue be as wax\" (3.4.82-84). One of Hamlet’s feelings throughout the play is rage. The cause of Hamlet’s rage would be Gertrude, for her hasty marriage and her mourning are not long. Hamlet vents his anger about it by insulting his mother, “Nay, but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, stew’d in corruption, honeying and making love over the nasty sty—“ (3.4.91-93). Therefore Gertrude helps build Hamlet’s personality. Gertrude’s actions also help Hamlet with his drive to kill Claudius. Gertrude is Hamlet’s shield. She protects him as a hawk would protect its babies. If Gertrude was not Hamlet’s mother or of royalty, than Hamlet would be dead. Laetes and Claudius are having a private discussion when Leartes asks why he has not murdered Hamlet yet, Claudius answers “The queen his mother lives almost by his looks; and for myself—my virtue or my plague, be it either which—she’s so conjunctive to my life and soul\" (4.7.11-14). Another incident where Gertrude protects Hamlet, without realizing, is when she drinks Hamlets goblet which is mixed with poison. This is what could have killed Hamlet if he did not get cut by the rapier and thus she is Hamlet’s shield. Hamlet dies after she dies because now Hamlet is defenseless and cannot hide behind her for protection, his shield is broken. In conclusion Gertrude is a strong character in the play and affects the plot. She is a loving caring character and wants everyone to get along with each other. Gertrude also symbolizes Hamlet’s shield and protection.\\nAnalysis #2\\nHamlet features many central characters, each following their own shifting paths based around their own actions. One of these characters, the Queen Gertrude, Hamlet’s mother, tends to stir the plot with her own ill-thought actions. This is not to say that Gertrude means to cause harm, she is simply not the brightest character in this play.\\nGertrude’s first action in the play is marrying Claudius, an action which sets a disturbed young Hamlet over the edge with her incestuous marriage to his uncle. Without her knowledge, Gertrude causes the main problem in Hamlet’s life, and she does so only thinking about herself and her adulterous ways. Shakespeare portrays her as a sexually driven, almost ditzy character. She tends to not think beyond her own pleasure, which causes more problems than she notices, especially with her son, Hamlet. “Gertrude is the antithesis of her son. Hamlet is a scholar, and brightly witted, where Gertrude does not think before she acts, she simply does.\" (Amanda Mabillard in Shakespeare’s Gertrude)\\nMany of the characters in Hamlet follow a recognizable path through the play, shifting and changing around events. Gertrude, on the\\nother hand, stays mostly a flat line, ignoring the cries of her son and yielding to Claudius’ wants. She stays this way until Hamlet tells her how he feels, and even then, she does not react in a very big way. Even after Hamlet stabs Polonius, she is still removed from the situation, struggling to digest what Hamlet is telling her. At most, she seems surprised, but not realizing that she has caused Hamlet’s actions.\\n“She is a very caring character when Hamlet is thinking about going back to Wittenberg for reasons that are unknown, Gertrude tells Hamlet, “Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet; I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg\" (1.2,18-19). She is also confused because she wants to \" (Phil Anderson of schoolworkhelper.net, Queen Gertrude Character Analysis (Hamlet)) Mr. Anderson interprets the quote deeper to come to the conclusion that Gertrude is actually trying to protect Hamlet, but not seeing that she is actually harming him. Anderson also says that she is trying to “love two people who dislike each other, Hamlet and Claudius, so she tries to satisfy both men,\" but only succeeds in satisfying her new King, while a mortified Hamlet struggles to cope in the background.\\nProbably one of the most reputable sources for Shakespeare Analysis is Oxon Pseud, a studied scholar and published author. In his book An Analysis and Study of the Leading Characters of Hamlet, he says “Gertrude was in no sense an accomplice of Claudius. Of her husband’s murder she knew nothing, till Hamlet denounced Claudius as a murderer.\" Pseud also goes on to give examples of her innocence.\\nThe ghost says nothing of her guilt. The ghost says that Gertrude is adulterous and lustful, but never guilty. Another point in Hamlet in III.iv., would not have merely denounced her second marriage, had he not considered her guilty of murder, a far more heinous crime. Also, The king never treats Gertrude as an accomplice. Indeed she is by no means the sharer of all his secrets.\\nGertrude also never lets drop a word from which her guilt can be inferred. Though she speaks sparsely, in her dialogue she never mentions that she married Claudius out of spite for her late first husband. Also, if she were an accomplice to the murder of Hamlet Sr., in the least degree, her conscience, which has great power over her, would have made her show it.\\nIf she were guilty, her consummate self-command in concealing that fact entitles her to be  regarded as the strongest character in the play, whereas in all other respects she is one of the weakest.\\nOxon also tells of her guilt: She has committed adultery, she has remarried with indecent haste, she has cast a slur on her son by her misconduct and other reasons.\\nAll scholars seem to agree on one point: Gertrude does not mean harm, but still causes harm to those around her.  Orah Rosenblatt in her Gertrude in Hamlet, Critical Analysis Essays, says “Gertrude is a woman who means no harm but whose poor judgment contributes greatly to the terrible events that occur.\" In Hamlet, Gertrude’s ill-thought actions cause many events to unfold, including the accidental murder of Polonius. Orah also brings to the surface another excellent point: “There are only two female characters in the play, and neither one–Gertrude or Ophelia–is assertive.\" Orah points out that none of the women in Hamlet seem to have a say over what happens to them, and they only cause more issues than they prevent. This could also be an inside look into Shakespeare’s own views on women. “We first realize in Act I, Scene 2 that poor judgment is her major character flaw. As the mother of a grieving son, Gertrude should have been more sensitive to Hamlet’s feelings. Instead, less than two months after King Hamlet’s death, Gertrude remarries Claudius, her dead husband’s own brother.\" Gertrude is portrayed as a loving mother, but not necessarily the most outwardly thinking. Any normal mother or even human being would have realized the issues that Hamlet was facing and would have tried to help.  As Hamlet said, “O, most wicked speed, to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets! (I.ii 156-157)\" This quote serves as an excellent outline for why Hamlet is so upset.\\nDelving deeper into Gertrude’s relationship with Claudius, Sasha Safonova in her Character Analysis of Gertrude in Hamlet explains how Hamlet’s mother’s incestuous relationship destroys his life and others. “Gertrude’s decision to marry her brother-in-law allows for great controversy among her surrounding society. Most importantly, this movement hurt her son Hamlet. Gertrude’s unsafe situation made her go against the society’s rules and quarrel viciously with her child.\" Gertrude does not realize how taboo and harmful her relationship is with Hamlet’s once Uncle, now Father. She can almost be seen as a modern day “stereotypical dumb blonde,\" though there is no indication as to her hair color. It’s almost pitiful how unaware Gertrude is throughout the entire play (until Hamlet tells her otherwise) about the situations she creates.\\nThough she may not mean harm, Gertrude does manage to cause harm to those around her. Her lackadaisical thinking patterns eventually end in her downfall, when she drinks the poisoned wine meant for Hamlet. Much in the same way Polonius’ character flaws lead to his death, Gertrude’s do to her, too.\\nThere is a term in Sociology which describes what Hamlet is going through after seeing his mother’s actions. The term is Grandiose Self, which can defined: As a child, you see your parents as perfect. When they show weakness, you reflect that upon your own faults and actions. Gertrude is certainly not in any way a flawless mother, leaving Hamlet with a shattered matriarchal figure and lost at what he should be feeling.\\nIt could also be argued that Gertrude employs the use of Cognitive Dissonance, meaning that, though she knows incest is wrong, she creates a new belief system or rationalization in order to justify her new relationship with Claudius. It has also been noted by many scholars that Gertrude may have been an alcoholic, concerned only with herself, explaining her narcissistic actions.\\nGertrude is almost a textbook narcissist. She does not see the world outside of herself, and she does not care about what happens to others as long as she can derive pleasure from her actions. Her lack of empathy or outside thought provide enough evidence for readers to conclude that she does display narcissistic characteristics.\\nGertrude may not have as much stage time in the play Hamlet, but she is still a pivotal character in her actions and how her actions effect others, namely, Hamlet. Like scholars say, Gertrude does not mean harm, but instead causes ill events to unfold because of her lack of outside thinking. Gertrude is more than just ‘Hamlet’s mom,’ she is her character, like all of the other central characters in Hamlet. Her actions cause a beautifully crafted domino effect that collides with other characters’ in the play to come to a grand finale.\\nBibliography\\nAnderson, Phil.
